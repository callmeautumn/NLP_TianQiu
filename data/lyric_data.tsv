dan le sac vs scroobius pip-the beat that my heart skipped	https://www.azlyrics.com/d/danlesacvsscroobiuspip.html	the beat that my heart skipped	https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/danlesacvsscroobiuspip/thebeatthatmyheartskipped.html	every now and then i cower and i need to find empowerment, empowerment is paramount to how i can begin to mount, a plan that i can implement, to make a dent on ignorance, instead of drunk belligerence, and the dissidence of miscreants, especially in this instance, with the never ending persistence, to use the words in each sentence, as if they were blunt instruments, to beat a hole in the defense, of this beauty and her innocence, which serves to just build resistance, in spite of all my good intents. the beat that my heart skipped, this is the beat that my heart skipped when we first met, now that i've heard it, it leaves me with a kind of regret, no disrespect, but we left a lot of people upset, and what we had wasn't really what we'd come to expect, well good god damn and other such phrases, i haven't heard a beat like this in ages, to miss such a beat would have been outrageous, but when you heart skips a beat its ruthless and aimless, she caught my attention in her fishnets, then she reeled me in expecting nothing more than kissed necks and quick sex, but that weren't the case with this platinum princess, she's attracted my interest, so i wanted to impress'. upon her all the positive things, that come form having more than just a one night fling, but that's something that's easier in theory than in practice, since pick up lines are tactics, to get prey to the mattress, and this actress, is practiced, in shunning such theatrics, when put upon daily by tactless geriatrics, so my genuine advances are met with po-faced skepticism, throwing complements but she just straight elects to miss them, her lips were put on this earth for dispersing wisdom, god forbid i suggest she lets me kiss them, but i really want to know what she thinks of me, because i'm loving every idiosyncrasy, but i ain't one to jump through hoops to make a 1st impression, been there, done that, learnt the worst of lessons, we want to be loved for who we appear to be instead of who we are, so i real selves take a backseat behind the pomp and the facade, and that's as true of the rude boys, downing pints and acting hard, as of the kids shunning convention with clinical disregard
dan le sac vs scroobius pip-look for the woman	https://www.azlyrics.com/d/danlesacvsscroobiuspip.html	look for the woman	https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/danlesacvsscroobiuspip/lookforthewoman.html	there's a weight over me today, it's something i have to say, love you too much to leave, don't like you enough to stay, my head's in a mess, and i'm stressed, but i guess it's a test in the quest for happiness, and the rest of that mess, so i best just acquiesce, even though i've grown tired of you, and that ain't meant to sound spiteful, i'm just trying to be insightful, when i write all my emotions, in the night, all the stuff i try to fight, will just come out and the sad fact is, i'm so tired of you, love, it's a weird thing ain't it?, there's no way to explain it, but i swear, as well as pain, there should be joy, but we sustain, the same level of mundane, and it's numbing me through, i often wonder if i'd miss you, and still have the urge to kiss you, if an issue was to hit through, to this heart that now feels disused, and said issue was too big to just ignore, and i walked out on you?, the chances are i'd fall apart, and suffer seizures of the heart, as my chest begins to smart, the very second have to part, i want to go back to the start, but then again, maybe i'd just feel new. maybe i'd get my life on track, and start to focus my attack, on all the things my life just lacks, and start to claw my passion back, instead of living like a hack, half-committed, half-relaxed, i'd have nothing to lose, there's a weight over me today, it's something i have to say, love you too much to leave, don't like you enough to stay, there's a weight over me today, it's something i have to say, love you too much to leave, don't like you enough to stay, i guess lately i've had too much time to think, and yeah, way too much drink, when paper meets the ink, overthinking is the chink in my armour, that's just what i do, and i've always been that way, forever questioning each day and every plea that's made that maybe, when i lay my busy mind will make me prove by finding problems and reasons, that might not even be true. see, we got together so young, before our real lives had begun, but flowers don't grow up as one, each finds its own way to the sun, and that's exactly what we've done. we've grown up separately too, and for a few years now it's been the problem, and these realisations, i wish that i could stop them, but i've realised that love is all we have in common, and deep down you know that's true. but then surely that i'm still in love with you means there's something we can do, to get us through and to pursue a brand new point of view on how this gap grew, between me and you. so there's a weight over me and i'd hate to have to leave, but in fate i don't believe and the state of you and me isn't great as you can see, so i'll keep thinking this through. there's a weight over me today, it's something i have to say, love you too much to leave, don't like you enough to stay, there's a weight over me today, it's something i have to say, love you too much to leave, don't like you enough to stay, there's a weight over me today, it's something i had to say, love you too much to leave, don't like you enough to stay, there's a weight over me today, it's something i have to say, love you too much to leave, don't like you enough to stay

beach boys-california saga: the beaks of eagles	https://www.azlyrics.com/b/beachboys.html	california saga: the beaks of eagles	https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beachboys/californiasagathebeaksofeagles.html	an eagle's nest on the head of an old redwood on one of the, precipice-footed ridges, above ventana creek, that jagged country which nothing but a fallen, meteor will ever plow: no horseman, will ever ride there, no hunter cross this ridge but the winged ones, no, one will steal the eggs from this fortress. the she-eagle is old, her mate was shot long ago, she is now mated, with a son of hers. when lightning blasted her nest she built it again on the same tree, in, the splinters of the thunder bolt. in a broken shack an old man takes his time about dyin', and just at the back a wild flowerbed that he'll lie in, in dawn's new light a man might venture, a horse drawn stage from monterey. the she-eagle is older than i: she was here when the fires of eighty-five, raged on these ridges, she was lately fledged and dared not hunt ahead of them, but ate scorched meat. the world has changed in her time; humanity has multiplied, but not here; men's hopes and thoughts and customs have changed, their, powers are enlarged, their powers and their follies have become fantastic. spilled down the hill a wagon load of bodies lay scattered, shipwrecked at sea. limestone ore is all that mattered. they took it from the hills right through the cargo doors, how many ships have come and gone at thurso's landing shore?, the unstable animal never has been changed so rapidly. the motor and the plane and the great war have gone over him, and lenin has lived and jehovah died: while the mother-eagle, hunts her same hills, crying the same beautiful and lonely cry, and is never tired: dreams the same dreams, and hears at night the rock-slides rattle and thunder in the, throats of these living mountains. it is good for man, to try all changes, progress and corruption, powers, peace and anguish, not to go down the dinosaur's way, until all his capacities have been explored: and it is good for him, to know that his needs and nature are no more changed, in fact, in ten, thousand years than the beaks of eagles. of the eagle's plight, we know that nature's balance is undone. and it's the birthright of man to unify and live his life as one. a whisper of the word will let you soar with your soul.
