erecting beyond the boundaries of all government his grand station and customs i find what i have made there a gate a staking out of his art in inconsequence
i have in mind a poetry that will frame the willingness of the heart and deliver it over to the arrest of time a sentence as if there could stand some solidity most spacial in its intent against the drifts and appearances that arise and fall away in time from the crude events of physical space
the mind alone holds the consequence of the erection to be true so that desire and imagination usurp the place of the invisible throne
