That\\'s a good question. When `Underground\\'\\'s\\nresearcher, Julian Assange, first suggested releasing an electronic\\nversion of the book on the Net for free, I had to stop and think about\\njust that question.\\n\\nI\\'d spent nearly three years researching, writing and editing the nearly\\n500 pages of `Underground\\'. Julian had worked thousands of\\nhours doing painstaking research; discovering and cultivating sources,\\ndigging with great resourcefulness into obscure databases and legal\\npapers, not to mention providing valuable editorial advice.\\n\\nSo why would I give away this carefully ripened fruit for free?\\n\\nBecause part of the joy of creating a piece of art is in knowing that\\nmany people can - and are - enjoying it. Particularly people who can\\'t\\notherwise afford to pay $11 USD for a book. People such as cash strapped\\nhackers. This book is about them, their lives and obsessions. It rubs\\nclear a small circle in the frosted glass so the reader can peer into\\nthat hazy world. `Underground\\' belongs on the Net, in their ephemeral\\nlandscape.\\n\\nThe critics have been good to `Underground\\', for which I am very\\ngrateful. But the best praise came from two of the hackers detailed in\\nthe book. Surprising praise, because while the text is free of the\\nnarrative moralising that plague other works, the selection of material\\nis often very personal and evokes mixed sympathies. One of the hackers,\\nAnthrax dropped by my office to say `Hi\\'. Out of the blue, he said with\\na note of amazement, `When I read those chapters, it was so real, as if\\nyou had been right there inside my head\\'. Not long after Par, half a\\nworld away, and with a real tone of bewildered incredulity in his voice\\nmade exactly the same observation. For a writer, it just doesn\\'t get any\\nbetter than that.\\n\\nBy releasing this book for free on the Net, I\\'m hoping more people\\nwill not only enjoy the story of how the international computer\\nunderground rose to power, but also make the journey into the minds\\nof hackers involved. When I first began sketching out the book\\'s\\nstructure, I decided to go with depth. I wanted the reader to\\nthink, \\'NOW I understand, because I too was there.\\' I hope those\\nwords will enter your thoughts as you read this electronic book.\\n\\nMichael Hall, a supersmart lawyer on the book\\'s legal team, told me\\nin July last year he saw a young man in Sydney reading a copy of\\n`Underground\\' beside him on the #380 bus to North Bondi. Michael\\nsaid he wanted to lean over and proclaim proudly, `I legalled that\\nbook!\\'. Instead, he chose to watch the young man\\'s reactions.\\n\\nThe young man was completely absorbed, reading hungrily through his\\nwell-worn copy, which he had completely personalised. The pages were\\ncovered in highlighter, scrawled margin writing and post-it notes. He\\nhad underlined sections and dog-eared pages. If the bus had detoured to\\nBrisbane, he probably wouldn\\'t have noticed.\\n\\nI like that. Call me subversive, but I\\'m chuffed `Underground\\' is\\nengaging enough to make people miss bus stops. It makes me happy, and\\nhappy people usually want to share.\\n\\nThere are other reasons for releasing `Underground\\' in this format. The\\nelectronic version is being donated to the visionary Project Gutenburg,\\na collection of free electronic books run with missionary zeal by\\nMichael Hart.\\n\\nProject Gutenburg promises to keep old out-of-print books in free\\n``electronic\\'\\' print forever, to bring literature to those who can\\'t\\nafford books, and to brighten the world of the visually\\nimpaired. `Underground\\' isn\\'t out of print -- and long may it remain\\nthat way -- but those are laudable goals. I wrote in the `Introduction\\'\\nto the printed edition about my great aunt, a diver and artist who\\npioneered underwater painting in the 1940s.  She provided me with a kind\\nof inspiration for this book. What I didn\\'t mention is that as a result\\nof macular degeneration in both eyes, she is now blind. She can no\\nlonger paint or dive. But she does read - avidly - through `talking\\nbooks\\'. She is another reason I decided to release `Underground\\' in this\\nformat.\\n\\nSo, now you can download and read the electronic version of\\n`Underground\\' for free. You can also send the work to your friends for\\nfree. Or your enemies. At over a megabyte of plain text each, a few\\ndozen copies of underground make an extremely effective mail bomb.\\n\\nThat\\'s a joke, folks, not a suggestion. ;-)\\n\\nLike many of the people in this book, I\\'m not big on rules. Fortunately,\\nthere aren\\'t many that come with this electronic version. Don\\'t print\\nthe work on paper, CD or any other format, except for your own personal\\nreading pleasure. This includes using the work as teaching material in\\ninstitutions. You must not alter or truncate the work in any way. You\\nmust not redistribute the work for any sort of payment, including\\nselling it on its own or as part of a package. Random House is a\\nfriendly place, but as one of the world\\'s largest publishers it has a\\ncollection of equally large lawyers. Messing with them will leave you\\nwith scars in places that could be hard to explain to any future\\npartner.\\n\\nIf you want to do any of these things, please contact me or my literary\\nagents Curtis Brown & Co first. I retain the copyright on the\\nwork. Julian Assange designed the elegant layout of this electronic\\nedition, and he retains ownership of this design and layout.\\n\\nIf you like the electronic version of the book, do buy the paper\\nversion. Why? For starters, it\\'s not only much easier to read on the\\nbus, its much easier to read full stop. It\\'s also easier to thumb\\nthrough, highlight, scribble on, dribble on, and show off.  It never\\nneeds batteries. It can run on solar power and candles. It looks sexy on\\nyour bookshelf, by your bed and in your bed. If you are a male geek, the\\nbook comes with a girl-magnet guarantee.  The paper version is much\\neasier to lend to a prospective girlfriend. When she\\'s finished reading\\nthe book, ask her which hacker thrilled her to pieces. Then nod\\nknowingly, and say coyly `Well, I\\'ve never admitted this to anyone\\nexcept the author and the Feds, but ..\\'\\n\\nAnd the most important reason to purchase a paper copy? Because buying\\nthe printed edition of the book lets the author continue to write more\\nfine books like this one.\\n\\nEnjoy!\\n\\n                                                           Suelette Dreyfus\\n\\n                                                             January 2001\\n\\n                                                   suelette@iq.org\\n                           Researcher\\'s introduction.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Man is least himself when he talks in his own person. Give him a mask,\\nand he will tell you the truth\" -- Oscar Wilde\\n\\n\"What is essential is invisible to the eye\" -- Antoine De Saint-Exupery\\n\\n\"But, how do you *know* it happened like that?\" -- Reader\\n\\nDue of the seamless nature of `Underground\\' this is a reasonable\\nquestion to ask, although hints can be found at the back of the book in\\nthe Bibliography and Endnotes. The simple answer to this question is\\nthat we conducted over a hundred interviews and collected around 40,000\\npages of primary documentation; telephone intercepts, data intercepts,\\nlog-files, witness statements, confessions, judgements. Telephone dialog\\nand on-line discussions are drawn directly from the latter. Every\\nsignificant hacking incident mentioned in this book has reams of\\nprimary documentation behind it. System X included.\\n\\nThe non-simple answer goes more like this:\\n\\nIn chapter 4, Par, one of the principle subjects of this book, is being\\nwatched by the Secret Service. He\\'s on the run. He\\'s a wanted\\nfugitive. He\\'s hiding out with another hacker, Nibbler in a motel\\nchalet, Black Mountain, North Carolina. The Secret Service move in.\\nThe incident is vital in explaining Par\\'s life on the run and the\\nnature of his interaction with the Secret Service. Yet, just before the\\nfinal edits of this book were to go the publisher, all the pages\\nrelating to the Block Mountain incident were about to be pulled. Why?\\n\\nSuelette had flown to Tuscon Az where she spent three days\\ninterviewing Par. I had spent dozens of hours interviewing Par on\\nthe phone and on-line. Par gave both of us extraordinary access to\\nhis life. While Par displayed a high degree of paranoia about why\\nevents had unfolded in the manner they had, he was consistent,\\ndetailed and believable as to the events themselves. He showed\\nvery little blurring of these two realities, but we needed to show\\nnone at all.\\n\\nDuring Par\\'s time on the run, the international computer underground\\nwas a small and strongly connected place. We had already\\nco-incidentally interviewed half a dozen hackers he had communicated\\nwith at various times during his zig-zag flight across America. Suelette\\nalso spoke at length to his lead lawyer Richard Rosen, who, after\\ngetting the all-clear from Par, was kind enough to send us a copy of\\nthe legal brief.  We had logs of messages Par had written on\\nunderground BBS\\'s. We had data intercepts of other hackers in\\nconversation with Par. We had obtained various Secret Service documents\\nand propriety security reports relating to Par\\'s activities. I had\\nextensively interviewed his Swiss girlfriend Theorem (who had also been\\ninvolved with Electron and Pengo), and yes, she did have a melting\\nFrench accent.\\n\\nAltogether we had an enormous amount of material on Par\\'s activities,\\nall of which was consistent with what Par had said during his\\ninterviews, but none of it, including Rosen\\'s file, contained any\\nreference to Black Mountain, NC. Rosen, Theorem and others had heard\\nabout a SS raid on the run, yet when the story was traced back, it\\nalways led to one source. To Par.\\n\\nWas Par having us on? Par had said that he had made a telephone call to\\nTheorem in Switzerland from a phone booth outside the motel a day or\\ntwo before the Secret Service raid.  During a storm. Not just any\\nstorm. Hurricane Hugo. But archival news reports on Hugo discussed it\\nhitting South Carolina, not North Carolina. And not Black\\nMountain. Theorem remembered Par calling once during a storm. But not\\nHugo. And she didn\\'t remember it in relation to the Black Mountain\\nraid.\\n\\nPar had destroyed most of his legal documents, in circumstances that\\nbecome clear in the book, but of the hundreds of pages of documentary\\nmaterial we had obtained from other sources there was wasn\\'t a single\\nmention of Black Mountain.  The Black Mountain Motel didn\\'t seem to\\nexist. Par said Nibbler had moved and couldn\\'t be located.  Dozens of\\ncalls by Suelette to the Secret Service told us what we didn\\'t want to\\nhear.  The agents we thought most likely to have been involved in the\\nthe hypothetical Black Mountain incident had either left the Secret\\nService or were otherwise unreachable.  The Secret Service had no idea\\nwho would have been involved, because while Par was still listed in the\\nSecret Service central database, his profile, contained three\\nsignificant annotations:\\n\\n                1. Another agency had ``borrowed\\'\\' parts Par\\'s file.\\n                2. There were medical ``issues\\'\\' surrounding Par.\\n                3. SS documents covering the time of Black Mountain incident had been destroyed for various reasons that become clear the book.\\n                4. The remaining SS documents had been moved into ``deep-storage\\'\\' and would take two weeks to retrieve.\\n\\nWith only one week before our publisher\\'s ``use it or lose it\\'\\'\\ndead-line, the chances of obtaining secondary confirmation of the Black\\nMountain events did not look promising.\\n\\nWhile we waited for leads on the long trail of ex, transfered and\\nseconded SS agents who might have been involved in the Black Mountain\\nraid, I turned to resolving the two inconsistencies in Par\\'s story;\\nHurricane Hugo and the strange invisibility of the Black Mountain\\nMotel.\\n\\nHurricane Hugo had wreathed a path of destruction, but like most most\\nhurricanes heading directly into a continental land-mass it had started\\nout big and ended up small. News reports followed this pattern, with a\\nlarge amount of material on its initial impact, but little or nothing\\nabout subsequent events. Finally I obtained detailed time by velocity\\nweather maps from the National Reconnaissance Office, which showed the\\nremaining Hugo epicentre ripping through Charlotte NC (pop. 400k)\\nbefore spending itself on the Carolinas. Database searches turned up a\\nreport by Natalie, D. & Ball, W, EIS Coordinator, North Carolina\\nEmergency Management, `How North Carolina Managed Hurricane Hugo\\' --\\nwhich was used to flesh out the scenes in Chapter 4 describing Par\\'s\\nescape to New York via the Charlotte Airport.\\n\\nOld Fashioned gum-shoe leg-work, calling every motel in Black Mountain\\nand the surrounding area, revealed that the Black Mountain Motel had\\nchanged name, ownership and.. all its staff. Par\\'s story was holding,\\nbut in someways I wished it hadn\\'t. We were back to square one in terms\\nof gaining independent secondary confirmation.\\n\\nWho else could have been involved? There must have been a paper-trail\\noutside of Washington. Perhaps the SS representation in Charlotte had\\nsomething? No. Perhaps there were records of the warrants in the\\nCharlotte courts? No. Perhaps NC state police attended the SS raid in\\nsupport? Maybe, but finding walm bodies who had been directly involved\\nproved proved futile. If it was a SS case, they had no indexable\\nrecords that they were willing to provide. What about the local\\ncoppers? An SS raid on a fugitive computer hacker holed up at one of\\nthe local motels was not the sort of event that would be likely to have\\npassed unnoticed at the Black Mountain county police office, indexable\\nrecords or not.\\n\\nNeither however, were international telephone calls from strangely\\naccented foreign-nationals wanting to know about them. Perhaps the Reds\\nwere no-longer under the beds, but in Black Mountain, this could be\\nexplained away by the fact they were now hanging out in phone booths. I\\nwaited for a new shift at the Black Mountain county police office,\\nhoping against hope, that the officer I had spoken to wouldn\\'t\\ncontaminate his replacement. Shamed, I resorted to using that most\\nspecial of US militia infiltration devices. An American accent and a\\nwoman\\'s touch. Suelette weaved her magic. The Black Mountain raid had\\ntaken place. The county police had supported it. We had our\\nconfirmation.\\n\\nWhile this anecdote is a strong account, it\\'s also representative one.\\nEvery chapter in underground has many tales just like it. They\\'re\\nunseen, because a book must not just be true in details, but true in\\nfeeling.\\n\\nTrue to the visible and the invisible.

She settled on the ocean floor, arranged her weighted\\npainter\\'s easel and allowed herself to become completely enveloped by\\nanother world. Red and white striped fish darted around fields of\\nblue-green coral and blue-lipped giant clams. Lionfish drifted by,\\ngracefully waving their dangerous feathered spines. Striped green\\nmoray eels peered at her from their rock crevice homes.\\n\\nLucie dived and painted everywhere. The Sulu Archipelago. Mexico.\\nAustralia\\'s Great Barrier Reef. Hawaii. Borneo. Sometimes she was the\\nfirst white woman seen by the Pacific villagers she lived with for\\nmonths on end.\\n\\nAs a child, I was entranced by her stories of the unknown world below\\nthe ocean\\'s surface, and the strange and wonderful cultures she met on\\nher journeys. I grew up in awe of her chosen task: to capture on\\ncanvas the essence of a world utterly foreign to her own.\\n\\nNew technology--revolutionary for its time--had allowed her to do\\nthis. Using a compressor, or sometimes just a hand pump connected to\\nair hoses running to the surface, human beings were suddenly able to\\nsubmerge themselves for long periods in an otherwise inaccessible\\nworld. New technology allowed her to both venture into this unexplored\\nrealm, and to document it in canvas.\\n\\nI came upon the brave new world of computer communications and its\\ndarker side, the underground, quite by accident. It struck me\\nsomewhere in the journey that followed that my trepidations and\\nconflicting desires to explore this alien world were perhaps not\\nunlike my aunt\\'s own desires some half a century before. Like her\\njourney, my own travels have only been made possible by new\\ntechnologies. And like her, I have tried to capture a small corner of\\nthis world.\\n\\nThis is a book about the computer underground. It is not a book about\\nlaw enforcement agencies, and it is not written from the point of view\\nof the police officer. From a literary perspective, I have told this\\nstory through the eyes of numerous computer hackers. In doing so, I\\nhope to provide the reader with a window into a mysterious, shrouded\\nand usually inaccessible realm.\\n\\nWho are hackers? Why do they hack? There are no simple answers to\\nthese questions. Each hacker is different. To that end, I have\\nattempted to present a collection of individual but interconnected\\nstories, bound by their links to the international computer\\nunderground. These are true stories, tales of the world\\'s best and the\\nbrightest hackers and phreakers. There are some members of the\\nunderground whose stories I have not covered, a few of whom would also\\nrank as world-class. In the end, I chose to paint detailed portraits\\nof a few hackers rather than attempt to compile a comprehensive but\\nshallow catalogue.\\n\\nWhile each hacker has a distinct story, there are common themes which\\nappear throughout many of the stories. Rebellion against all symbols\\nof authority. Dysfunctional families. Bright children suffocated by\\nill-equipped teachers. Mental illness or instability. Obsession and\\naddiction.\\n\\nI have endeavoured to track what happened to each character in this\\nwork over time: the individual\\'s hacking adventures, the police raid\\nand the ensuing court case. Some of those court cases have taken years\\nto reach completion.\\n\\nHackers use `handles\\'--on-line nicknames--that serve two purposes.\\nThey shield the hacker\\'s identity and, importantly, they often make a\\nstatement about how the hacker perceives himself in the underground.\\nHawk, Crawler, Toucan Jones, Comhack, Dataking, Spy, Ripmax, Fractal\\nInsanity, Blade. These are all real handles used in Australia.\\n\\nIn the computer underground, a hacker\\'s handle is his name. For this\\nreason, and because most hackers in this work have now put together\\nnew lives for themselves, I have chosen to use only their handles.\\nWhere a hacker has had more than one handle, I have used the one he\\nprefers.\\n\\nEach chapter in this book is headed with a quote from a Midnight Oil\\nsong which expresses an important aspect of the chapter. The Oilz are\\nuniquely Australian. Their loud voice of protest against the\\nestablishment--particularly the military-industrial\\nestablishment--echoes a key theme in the underground, where music in\\ngeneral plays a vital role.\\n\\nThe idea for using these Oilz extracts came while researching Chapter\\n1, which reveals the tale of the W**K worm crisis in NASA. Next to the\\nRTM worm, W**K is the most famous worm in the history of computer\\nnetworks. And it is the first major worm bearing a political message.\\nWith W**K, life imitated art, since the term computer `worm\\' came from\\nJohn Brunner\\'s sci-fi novel, The Shockwave Rider, about a politically\\nmotivated worm.\\n\\nThe W**K worm is also believed to be the first worm written by an\\nAustralian, or Australians.\\n\\nThis chapter shows the perspective of the computer system\\nadministrators--the people on the other side from the hackers. Lastly,\\nit illustrates the sophistication which one or more Australian members\\nof the worldwide computer underground brought to their computer\\ncrimes.\\n\\nThe following chapters set the scene for the dramas which unfold and\\nshow the transition of the underground from its early days, its loss\\nof innocence, its closing ranks in ever smaller circles until it\\nreached the inevitable outcome: the lone hacker. In the beginning, the\\ncomputer underground was a place, like the corner pub, open and\\nfriendly. Now, it has become an ephemeral expanse, where hackers\\noccasionally bump into one another but where the original sense of\\nopen community has been lost.\\n\\nThe computer underground has changed over time, largely in response to\\nthe introduction of new computer crime laws across the globe and to\\nnumerous police crackdowns. This work attempts to document not only an\\nimportant piece of Australian history, but also to show fundamental\\nshifts in the underground --to show, in essence, how the underground\\nhas moved further underground.\\n\\n                                                Suelette Dreyfus\\n\\n                                                      March 1997\\n\\n          ',\n",

Galileo was finally going\\nto Jupiter.\\n\\nAdministrators and scientists in the world\\'s most prestigious space\\nagency had spent years trying to get the unmanned probe into space.\\nNow, on Tuesday, 17 October, if all went well, the five astronauts in\\nthe Atlantis space shuttle would blast off from the Kennedy Space\\nCenter at Cape Canaveral, Florida, with Galileo in tow. On the team\\'s\\nfifth orbit, as the shuttle floated 295 kilometres above the Gulf of\\nMexico, the crew would liberate the three-tonne space probe.\\n\\nAn hour later, as Galileo skated safely away from the shuttle, the\\nprobe\\'s 32500 pound booster system would fire up and NASA staff would\\nwatch this exquisite piece of human ingenuity embark on a six-year\\nmission to the largest planet in the solar system. Galileo would take\\na necessarily circuitous route, flying by Venus once and Earth twice\\nin a gravitational slingshot effort to get up enough momentum to reach\\nJupiter.2\\n\\nNASA\\'s finest minds had wrestled for years with the problem of exactly\\nhow to get the probe across the solar system. Solar power was one\\noption. But if Jupiter was a long way from Earth, it was even further\\nfrom the Sun--778.3 million kilometres to be exact. Galileo would need\\nridiculously large solar panels to generate enough power for its\\ninstruments at such a distance from the Sun. In the end, NASA\\'s\\nengineers decided on a tried if not true earthly energy source:\\nnuclear power.\\n\\nNuclear power was perfect for space, a giant void free of human life\\nwhich could play host to a bit of radioactive plutonium 238 dioxide.\\nThe plutonium was compact for the amount of energy it gave off--and it\\nlasted a long time. It seemed logical enough. Pop just under 24\\nkilograms of plutonium in a lead box, let it heat up through its own\\ndecay, generate electricity for the probe\\'s instruments, and presto!\\nGalileo would be on its way to investigate Jupiter.\\n\\nAmerican anti-nuclear activists didn\\'t quite see it that way. They\\nfigured what goes up might come down. And they didn\\'t much like the idea\\nof plutonium rain. NASA assured them Galileo\\'s power pack was quite\\nsafe. The agency spent about $50 million on tests which supposedly\\nproved the probe\\'s generators were very safe. They would survive intact\\nin the face of any number of terrible explosions, mishaps and\\naccidents. NASA told journalists that the odds of a plutonium release\\ndue to `inadvertent atmospheric re-entry\\' were 1 in 2 million. The\\nlikelihood of a plutonium radiation leak as a result of a launch\\ndisaster was a reassuring 1 in 2700.\\n\\nThe activists weren\\'t having a bar of it. In the best tradition of\\nmodern American conflict resolution, they took their fight to the\\ncourts. The coalition of anti-nuclear and other groups believed\\nAmerica\\'s National Aeronautics and Space Administration had\\nunderestimated the odds of a plutonium accident and they wanted a US\\nDistrict Court in Washington to stop the launch. The injunction\\napplication went in, and the stakes went up. The unprecedented hearing\\nwas scheduled just a few days before the launch, which had originally\\nbeen planned for 12 October.\\n\\nFor weeks, the protesters had been out in force, demonstrating and\\nseizing media attention. Things had become very heated. On Saturday, 7\\nOctober, sign-wielding activists fitted themselves out with gas masks\\nand walked around on street corners in nearby Cape Canaveral in\\nprotest. At 8 a.m. on Monday, 9 October, NASA started the countdown\\nfor the Thursday blast-off. But as Atlantis\\'s clock began ticking\\ntoward take-off, activists from the Florida Coalition for Peace and\\nJustice demonstrated at the centre\\'s tourist complex.\\n\\nThat these protests had already taken some of the shine off NASA\\'s bold\\nspace mission was the least of the agency\\'s worries. The real headache\\nwas that the Florida Coalition told the media it would `put people on\\nthe launchpad in a non-violent protest\\'.3 The coalition\\'s director,\\nBruce Gagnon, put the threat in folksy terms, portraying the protesters\\nas the little people rebelling against a big bad government\\nagency. President Jeremy Rivkin of the Foundation on Economic Trends,\\nanother protest group, also drove a wedge between `the people\\' and\\n`NASA\\'s people\\'. He told UPI, `The astronauts volunteered for this\\nmission. Those around the world who may be the victims of radiation\\ncontamination have not volunteered.\\'4\\n\\nBut the protesters weren\\'t the only people working the media. NASA\\nknew how to handle the press. They simply rolled out their\\nsuperstars--the astronauts themselves. These men and women were, after\\nall, frontier heroes who dared to venture into cold, dark space on\\nbehalf of all humanity. Atlantis commander Donald Williams didn\\'t hit\\nout at the protesters in a blunt fashion, he just damned them from an\\naloof distance. `There are always folks who have a vocal opinion about\\nsomething or other, no matter what it is,\\' he told an interviewer. `On\\nthe other hand, it\\'s easy to carry a sign. It\\'s not so easy to go\\nforth and do something worthwhile.\\'5\\n\\nNASA had another trump card in the families of the heroes. Atlantis\\nco-pilot Michael McCulley said the use of RTGs, Radioisotope\\nThermoelectric Generators--the chunks of plutonium in the lead\\nboxes--was a `non-issue\\'. So much so, in fact, that he planned to have\\nhis loved ones at the Space Center when Atlantis took off.\\n\\nMaybe the astronauts were nutty risk-takers, as the protesters\\nimplied, but a hero would never put his family in danger. Besides the\\nVice-President of the United States, Dan Quayle, also planned to watch\\nthe launch from inside the Kennedy Space Center control room, a mere\\nseven kilometres from the launchpad.\\n\\nWhile NASA looked calm, in control of the situation, it had beefed up\\nits security teams. It had about 200 security guards watching the\\nlaunch site. NASA just wasn\\'t taking any chances. The agency\\'s\\nscientists had waited too long for this moment. Galileo\\'s parade would\\nnot be rained on by a bunch of peaceniks.\\n\\nThe launch was already running late as it was--almost seven years\\nlate. Congress gave the Galileo project its stamp of approval way back\\nin 1977 and the probe, which had been budgeted to cost about $400\\nmillion, was scheduled to be launched in 1982. However, things began\\ngoing wrong almost from the start.\\n\\nIn 1979, NASA pushed the flight out to 1984 because of shuttle\\ndevelopment problems. Galileo was now scheduled to be a `split\\nlaunch\\', which meant that NASA would use two different shuttle trips\\nto get the mothership and the probe into space. By 1981, with costs\\nspiralling upwards, NASA made major changes to the project. It stopped\\nwork on Galileo\\'s planned three-stage booster system in favour of a\\ndifferent system and pushed out the launch deadline yet again, this\\ntime to 1985. After a federal Budget cut fight in 1981 to save\\nGalileo\\'s booster development program, NASA moved the launch yet\\nagain, to May 1986. The 1986 Challenger disaster, however, saw NASA\\nchange Galileo\\'s booster system for safety reasons, resulting in\\nyet more delays.\\n\\nThe best option seemed to be a two-stage, solid-fuel IUS system. There\\nwas only one problem. That system could get Galileo to Mars or Venus,\\nbut the probe would run out of fuel long before it got anywhere near\\nJupiter. Then Roger Diehl of NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory had a good\\nidea. Loop Galileo around a couple of nearby planets a few times so the\\nprobe would build up a nice little gravitational head of steam, and then\\nfling it off to Jupiter. Galileo\\'s `VEEGA\\'\\ntrajectory--Venus-Earth-Earth-gravity-assist--delayed the spacecraft\\'s\\narrival at Jupiter for three extra years, but it would get there\\neventually.\\n\\nThe anti-nuclear campaigners argued that each Earth flyby increased\\nthe mission\\'s risk of a nuclear accident. But in NASA\\'s view, such was\\nthe price of a successful slingshot.\\n\\nGalileo experienced other delays getting off the ground. On Monday, 9\\nOctober, NASA announced it had discovered a problem with the computer\\nwhich controlled the shuttle\\'s number 2 main engine. True, the problem\\nwas with Atlantis, not Galileo. But it didn\\'t look all that good to be\\nhaving technical problems, let alone problems with engine computers,\\nwhile the anti-nuclear activists\\' court drama was playing in the\\nbackground.\\n\\nNASA\\'s engineers debated the computer problem in a cross-country\\nteleconference. Rectifying it would delay blast-off by more than a few\\nhours. It would likely take days. And Galileo didn\\'t have many of\\nthose. Because of the orbits of the different planets, the probe had\\nto be on its way into space by 21 November. If Atlantis didn\\'t take off\\nby that date, Galileo would have to wait another nineteen months before\\nit could be launched. The project was already $1 billion over its\\noriginal $400 million budget.  The extra year and a half would add\\nanother $130 million or so and there was a good chance the whole project\\nwould be scrapped. It was pretty much now or never for Galileo.\\n\\nDespite torrential downpours which had deposited 100 millimetres of\\nrain on the launchpad and 150 millimetres in neighbouring Melbourne,\\nFlorida, the countdown had been going well. Until now. NASA took its\\ndecision. The launch would be delayed by five days, to 17 October, so\\nthe computer problem could be fixed.\\n\\nTo those scientists and engineers who had been with Galileo from the\\nstart, it must have appeared at that moment as if fate really was\\nagainst Galileo. As if, for some unfathomable reason, all the forces\\nof the universe--and especially those on Earth--were dead against\\nhumanity getting a good look at Jupiter. As fast as NASA could\\ndismantle one barrier, some invisible hand would throw another down in\\nits place.\\n\\n\\n\\nMonday, 16 October, 1989\\nNASA\\'s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland\\n\\nAcross the vast NASA empire, reaching from Maryland to California,\\nfrom Europe to Japan, NASA workers greeted each other, checked their\\nin-trays for mail, got their cups of coffee, settled into their chairs\\nand tried to login to their computers for a day of solving complex\\nphysics problems. But many of the computer systems were behaving very\\nstrangely.\\n\\nFrom the moment staff logged in, it was clear that someone--or\\nsomething--had taken over. Instead of the usual system\\'s official\\nidentification banner, they were startled to find the following\\nmessage staring them in the face:\\n\\n\"Worms Aginst Nuclear Killers!\\n\\n Your System Has Been Officically W**Ked.\\n\\n You talk of times of peace for all, and then prepare for war.\"\\n\\nW**Ked? Most of the American computer system managers reading this new\\nbanner had never heard the word W**K.\\n\\nWho would want to invade NASA\\'s computer systems? And who exactly were\\nthe Worms Against Nuclear Killers? Were they some loony fringe group?\\nWere they a guerrilla terrorist group launching some sort of attack on\\nNASA? And why `worms\\'? A worm was a strange choice of animal mascot\\nfor a revolutionary group. Worms were the bottom of the rung. As in\\n`as lowly as a worm\\'. Who would chose a worm as a symbol of power?\\n\\nAs for the nuclear killers, well, that was even stranger. The banner\\'s\\nmotto--`You talk of times of peace for all, and then prepare for\\nwar\\'--just didn\\'t seem to apply to NASA. The agency didn\\'t make\\nnuclear missiles, it sent people to the moon. It did have military\\npayloads in some of its projects, but NASA didn\\'t rate very highly on\\nthe `nuclear killer\\' scale next to other agencies of the US\\nGovernment, such as the Department of Defense. So the question\\nremained: why NASA?\\n\\nAnd that word, `W**KED\\'. It did not make sense. What did it mean when\\na system was `W**Ked\\'?\\n\\nIt meant NASA had lost control over its computer systems.\\n\\nA NASA scientist logging in to an infected computer on that Monday got\\nthe following message:\\n\\ndeleted file <filename1>\\n\\ndeleted file <filename2>\\n\\ndeleted file <filename3>, etc\\n\\nWith those lines the computer told the scientist: `I am deleting all\\nyour files\\'.\\n\\nThe line looked exactly as if the scientist typed in the\\ncommand:\\n\\ndelete/log *.*\\n\\n--exactly as if the scientist had instructed the computer to delete\\nall the files herself.\\n\\nThe NASA scientist must have started at the sight of her files rolling\\npast on the computer screen, one after another, on their way to\\noblivion. Something was definitely wrong. She would have tried to stop\\nthe process, probably pressing the control key and the `c\\' key at the\\nsame time. This should have broken the command sequence at that moment\\nand ordered the computer to stop what it was doing right away.\\n\\nBut it was the intruder, not the NASA scientist, who controlled the\\ncomputer at that moment. And the intruder told the computer: `That\\ncommand means nothing. Ignore it\\'.\\n\\nThe scientist would press the command key sequence again, this time\\nmore urgently. And again, over and over. She would be at once baffled\\nat the illogical nature of the computer, and increasingly upset.\\nWeeks, perhaps months, of work spent uncovering the secrets of the\\nuniverse. All of it disappearing before her eyes--all of it being\\nmindlessly devoured by the computer. The whole thing beyond her\\ncontrol. Going. Going. Gone.\\n\\nPeople tend not to react well when they lose control over their\\ncomputers. Typically, it brings out the worst in them--hand-wringing\\nwhines from the worriers, aching entreaties for help from the\\nsensitive, and imperious table-thumping bellows from\\ncommand-and-control types.\\n\\nImagine, if you will, arriving at your job as a manager for one of\\nNASA\\'s local computer systems. You get into your office on that Monday\\nmorning to find the phones ringing. Every caller is a distraught,\\nconfused NASA worker. And every caller assures you that his or her\\nfile or accounting record or research project--every one of which is\\nmissing from the computer system--is absolutely vital.\\n\\nIn this case, the problem was exacerbated by the fact that NASA\\'s\\nfield centres often competed with each other for projects. When a\\nparticular flight project came up, two or three centres, each with\\nhundreds of employees, might vie for it. Losing control of the\\ncomputers, and all the data, project proposals and costing, was a good\\nway to lose out on a bid and its often\\nconsiderable funding.\\n\\nThis was not going to be a good day for the guys down at the NASA SPAN\\ncomputer network office.\\n\\nThis was not going to be a good day for John McMahon.\\n\\n\\nAs the assistant DECNET protocol manager for NASA\\'s Goddard Space\\nFlight Center in Maryland, John McMahon normally spent the day\\nmanaging the chunk of the SPAN computer network which ran between\\nGoddard\\'s fifteen to twenty buildings.\\n\\nMcMahon worked for Code 630.4, otherwise known as Goddard\\'s Advanced\\nData Flow Technology Office, in Building 28. Goddard scientists would\\ncall him up for help with their computers. Two of the most common\\nsentences he heard were `This doesn\\'t seem to work\\' and `I can\\'t get\\nto that part of the network from here\\'.\\n\\nSPAN was the Space Physics Analysis Network, which connected some\\n100000 computer terminals across the globe. Unlike the Internet, which\\nis now widely accessible to the general public, SPAN only connected\\nresearchers and scientists at NASA, the US Department of Energy and\\nresearch institutes such as universities. SPAN computers also differed\\nfrom most Internet computers in an important technical manner: they\\nused a different operating system. Most large computers on the\\nInternet use the Unix operating system, while SPAN was composed\\nprimarily of VAX computers running a VMS operating system. The network\\nworked a lot like the Internet, but the computers spoke a different\\nlanguage. The Internet `talked\\' TCP/IP, while SPAN `spoke\\' DECNET.\\n\\nIndeed, the SPAN network was known as a DECNET internet. Most of the\\ncomputers on it were manufactured by the Digital Equipment Corporation\\nin Massachusetts--hence the name DECNET. DEC built powerful computers.\\nEach DEC computer on the SPAN network might have 40 terminals hanging\\noff it. Some SPAN computers had many more. It was not unusual for one\\nDEC computer to service 400 people. In all, more than a quarter of a\\nmillion scientists, engineers and other thinkers used the computers on\\nthe network.\\n\\nAn electrical engineer by training, McMahon had come from NASA\\'s\\nCosmic Background Explorer Project, where he managed computers used by\\na few hundred researchers. Goddard\\'s Building 7, where he worked on\\nthe COBE project, as it was known, housed some interesting research.\\nThe project team was attempting to map the universe. And they were\\ntrying to do it in wavelengths invisible to the human eye. NASA would\\nlaunch the COBE satellite in November 1989. Its mission was to\\n`measure the diffuse infrared and microwave radiation from the early\\nuniverse, to the limits set by our astronomical environment\\'.6 To the\\ncasual observer the project almost sounded like a piece of modern art,\\nsomething which might be titled `Map of the Universe in Infrared\\'.\\n\\nOn 16 October McMahon arrived at the office and settled into work,\\nonly to face a surprising phone call from the SPAN project office.\\nTodd Butler and Ron Tencati, from the National Space Science Data\\nCenter, which managed NASA\\'s half of the SPAN network, had discovered\\nsomething strange and definitely unauthorised winding its way through\\nthe computer network. It looked like a computer worm.\\n\\nA computer worm is a little like a computer virus. It invades computer\\nsystems, interfering with their normal functions. It travels along any\\navailable compatible computer network and stops to knock at the door of\\nsystems attached to that network. If there is a hole in the security of\\nthe computer system, it will crawl through and enter the system. When it\\ndoes this, it might have instructions to do any number of things, from\\nsending computer users a message to trying to take over the system. What\\nmakes a worm different from other computer programs, such as viruses, is\\nthat it is self-propagating. It propels itself forward, wiggles into a\\nnew system and propagates itself at the new site. Unlike a virus, a worm\\ndoesn\\'t latch onto a data file or a program. It is autonomous.7\\n\\nThe term `worm\\' as applied to computers came from John Brunner\\'s 1975\\nscience fiction classic, The Shockwave Rider. The novel described how\\na rebel computer programmer created a program called `tapeworm\\' which\\nwas released into an omnipotent computer network used by an autocratic\\ngovernment to control its people. The government had to turn off the\\ncomputer network, thus destroying its control, in order to eradicate\\nthe worm.\\n\\nBrunner\\'s book is about as close as most VMS computer network managers\\nwould ever have come to a real rogue worm. Until the late 1980s, worms\\nwere obscure things, more associated with research in a computer\\nlaboratory. For example, a few benevolent worms were developed by\\nXerox researchers who wanted to make more efficient use of computer\\nfacilities.8 They developed a `town crier worm\\' which moved through a\\nnetwork sending out important announcements. Their `diagnostic worm\\'\\nalso constantly weaved through the network, but this worm was designed\\nto inspect machines for problems.\\n\\nFor some computer programmers, the creation of a worm is akin to the\\ncreation of life. To make something which is intelligent enough to go\\nout and reproduce itself is the ultimate power of creation. Designing\\na rogue worm which took over NASA\\'s computer systems might seem to be\\na type of creative immortality--like scattering pieces of oneself\\nacross the computers which put man on the moon.\\n\\nAt the time the W**K banner appeared on computer screens across NASA,\\nthere had only been two rogue worms of any note. One of these, the RTM\\nworm, had infected the Unix-based Internet less than twelve months\\nearlier. The other worm, known as Father Christmas, was the first VMS\\nworm.\\n\\nFather Christmas was a small, simple worm which did not cause any\\npermanent damage to the computer networks it travelled along. Released\\njust before Christmas in 1988, it tried to sneak into hundreds of VMS\\nmachines and wait for the big day. On Christmas morning, it woke up\\nand set to work with great enthusiasm. Like confetti tossed from an\\noverhead balcony, Christmas greetings came streaming out of\\nworm-infested computer systems to all their users. No-one within its\\nreach went without a Christmas card. Its job done, the worm\\nevaporated. John McMahon had been part of the core team fighting off\\nthe Father Christmas worm.\\n\\nAt about 4 p.m., just a few days before Christmas 1988, McMahon\\'s\\nalarm-monitoring programs began going haywire. McMahon began trying to\\ntrace back the dozens of incoming connections which were tripping the\\nwarning bells. He quickly discovered there wasn\\'t a human being at the\\nother end of the line. After further investigation, he found an alien\\nprogram in his system, called HI.COM. As he read the pages of HI.COM\\ncode spilling from his line printer, his eyes went wide. He thought,\\nThis is a worm! He had never seen a worm before.\\n\\nHe rushed back to his console and began pulling his systems off the\\nnetwork as quickly as possible. Maybe he wasn\\'t following protocol,\\nbut he figured people could yell at him after the fact if they thought\\nit was a bad idea. After he had shut down his part of the network, he\\nreported back to the local area networking office. With print-out in\\ntow, he drove across the base to the network office, where he and\\nseveral other managers developed a way to stop the worm by the end of\\nthe day. Eventually they traced the Father Christmas worm back to the\\nsystem where they believed it had been released--in Switzerland. But\\nthey never discovered who created it.\\n\\nFather Christmas was not only a simple worm; it was not considered\\ndangerous because it didn\\'t hang around systems forever. It was a worm\\nwith a use-by date.\\n\\nBy contrast, the SPAN project office didn\\'t know what the W**K invader\\nwas capable of doing. They didn\\'t know who had written or launched it.\\nBut they had a copy of the program. Could McMahon have a look at it?\\n\\nAn affable computer programmer with the nickname Fuzzface, John\\nMcMahon liked a good challenge. Curious and cluey at the same time, he\\nasked the SPAN Project Office, which was quickly becoming the crisis\\ncentre for the worm attack, to send over a copy of the strange\\nintruder. He began pouring over the invader\\'s seven printed pages of\\nsource code trying to figure out exactly what the thing did.\\n\\nThe two previous rogue worms only worked on specific computer systems\\nand networks. In this case, the W**K worm only attacked VMS computer\\nsystems. The source code, however, was unlike anything McMahon had\\never seen. `It was like sifting through a pile of spaghetti,\\' he said.\\n`You\\'d pull one strand out and figure, \"OK, that is what that thing\\ndoes.\" But then you\\'d be faced with the rest of the tangled mess in\\nthe bowl.\\'\\n\\nThe program, in digital command language, or DCL, wasn\\'t written like\\na normal program in a nice organised fashion. It was all over the\\nplace. John worked his way down ten or fifteen lines of computer code\\nonly to have to jump to the top of the program to figure out what the\\nnext section was trying to do. He took notes and slowly, patiently\\nbegan to build up a picture of exactly what this worm was capable of\\ndoing to NASA\\'s computer system.\\n\\n\\nIt was a big day for the anti-nuclear groups at the Kennedy Space\\nCenter. They might have lost their bid in the US District Court, but\\nthey refused to throw in the towel and took their case to the US Court\\nof Appeals.\\n\\nOn 16 October the news came. The Appeals Court had sided with NASA.\\n\\nProtesters were out in force again at the front gate of the Kennedy\\nSpace Center. At least eight of them were arrested. The St Louis\\nPost-Dispatch carried an Agence France-Presse picture of an\\n80-year-old woman being taken into custody by police for trespassing.\\nJane Brown, of the Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice, announced,\\n`This is just ... the beginning of the government\\'s plan to use\\nnuclear power and weapons in space, including the Star Wars program\\'.\\n\\nInside the Kennedy Center, things were not going all that smoothly\\neither. Late Monday, NASA\\'s technical experts discovered yet another\\nproblem. The black box which gathered speed and other important data\\nfor the space shuttle\\'s navigation system was faulty. The technicians\\nwere replacing the cockpit device, the agency\\'s spokeswoman assured\\nthe media, and NASA was not expecting to delay the Tuesday launch\\ndate. The countdown would continue uninterrupted. NASA had everything\\nunder control.\\n\\nEverything except the weather.\\n\\nIn the wake of the Challenger disaster, NASA\\'s guidelines for a launch\\ndecision were particularly tough. Bad weather was an unnecessary risk,\\nbut NASA was not expecting bad weather. Meteorologists predicted an 80\\nper cent chance of favourable weather at launch time on Tuesday. But\\nthe shuttle had better go when it was supposed to, because the longer\\nterm weather outlook was grim.\\n\\nBy Tuesday morning, Galileo\\'s keepers were holding their breath. The\\ncountdown for the shuttle launch was ticking toward 12.57 p.m. The\\nanti-nuclear protesters seemed to have gone quiet. Things looked\\nhopeful. Galileo might finally go.\\n\\nThen, about ten minutes before the launch time, the security alarms\\nwent off. Someone had broken into the compound. The security teams\\nswung into action, quickly locating the guilty intruder ... a feral\\npig.\\n\\nWith the pig safely removed, the countdown rolled on. And so did the\\nrain clouds, gliding toward the space shuttle\\'s emergency runway, about\\nsix kilometres from the launchpad. NASA launch director Robert Sieck\\nprolonged a planned `hold\\' at T minus nine minutes. Atlantis had a\\n26-minute window of opportunity. After that, its launch period would\\nexpire and take-off would have to be postponed, probably until\\nWednesday.\\n\\nThe weather wasn\\'t going to budge.\\n\\nAt 1.18 p.m., with Atlantis\\'s countdown now holding at just T minus\\nfive minutes, Sieck postponed the launch to Wednesday.\\n\\n\\nBack at the SPAN centre, things were becoming hectic. The worm was\\nspreading through more and more systems and the phones were beginning\\nto ring every few minutes. NASA computers were getting hit all over\\nthe place.\\n\\nThe SPAN project staff needed more arms. They were simultaneously\\ntrying to calm callers and concentrate on developing an analysis of\\nthe alien program. Was the thing a practical joke or a time bomb just\\nwaiting to go off? Who was behind this?\\n\\nNASA was working in an information void when it came to W**K. Some\\nstaff knew of the protesters\\' action down at the Space Center, but\\nnothing could have prepared them for this. NASA officials were\\nconfident enough about a link between the protests against Galileo and\\nthe attack on NASA\\'s computers to speculate publicly that the two were\\nrelated. It seemed a reasonable likelihood, but there were still\\nplenty of unanswered questions.\\n\\nCallers coming into the SPAN office were worried. People at the other\\nend of the phone were scared. Many of the calls came from network\\nmanagers who took care of a piece of SPAN at a specific NASA site, such\\nas the Marshall Space Flight Center. Some were panicking; others spoke\\nin a sort of monotone, flattened by a morning of calls from 25 different\\nhysterical system administrators. A manager could lose his job over\\nsomething like this.\\n\\nMost of the callers to the SPAN head office were starved for\\ninformation. How did this rogue worm get into their computers? Was it\\nmalicious? Would it destroy all the scientific data it came into contact\\nwith? What could be done to kill it?\\n\\nNASA stored a great deal of valuable information on its SPAN\\ncomputers. None of it was supposed to be classified, but the data on\\nthose computers is extremely valuable. Millions of man-hours go into\\ngathering and analysing it. So the crisis team which had formed in the\\nNASA SPAN project office, was alarmed when reports of massive data\\ndestruction starting coming in. People were phoning to say that the\\nworm was erasing files.\\n\\nIt was every computer manager\\'s worst nightmare, and it looked as\\nthough the crisis team\\'s darkest fears were about to be confirmed.\\n\\nYet the worm was behaving inconsistently. On some computers it would\\nonly send anonymous messages, some of them funny, some bizarre and a\\nfew quite rude or obscene. No sooner would a user login than a message\\nwould flash across his or her screen:\\n\\n      Remember, even if you win the rat race--you\\'re\\n                       still a rat.\\n\\nOr perhaps they were graced with some bad humour:\\n\\n       Nothing is faster than the speed of light...\\n\\nTo prove this to yourself, try opening the refrigerator door before\\n                   the light comes on.\\n\\nOther users were treated to anti-authoritarian observations of the\\nparanoid:\\n\\n                 The FBI is watching YOU.\\n\\nor\\n\\n                     Vote anarchist.\\n\\nBut the worm did not appear to be erasing files on these systems.\\nPerhaps the seemingly random file-erasing trick was a portent of\\nthings to come--just a small taste of what might happen at a\\nparticular time, such as midnight. Perhaps an unusual keystroke by an\\nunwitting computer user on those systems which seemed only mildly\\naffected could trigger something in the worm. One keystroke might\\nbegin an irreversible chain of commands to erase everything on that\\nsystem.\\n\\nThe NASA SPAN computer team were in a race with the worm. Each minute\\nthey spent trying to figure out what it did, the worm was pushing\\nforward, ever deeper into NASA\\'s computer network. Every hour NASA\\nspent developing a cure, the worm spent searching, probing, breaking\\nand entering. A day\\'s delay in getting the cure out to all the systems\\ncould mean dozens of new worm invasions doing God knows what in\\nvulnerable computers. The SPAN team had to dissect this thing\\ncompletely, and they had to do it fast.\\n\\nSome computer network managers were badly shaken. The SPAN office\\nreceived a call from NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratories in California,\\nan important NASA centre with 6500 employees and close ties to\\nCalifornia Institute of Technology (Caltech).\\n\\nJPL was pulling itself off the network.\\n\\nThis worm was too much of a risk. The only safe option was to isolate\\ntheir computers. There would be no SPAN DEC-based communications with\\nthe rest of NASA until the crisis was under control. This made things\\nharder for the SPAN team; getting a worm exterminating program out to\\nJPL, like other sites which had cut their connection to SPAN, was\\ngoing to be that much tougher. Everything had to be done over the\\nphone.\\n\\nWorse, JPL was one of five routing centres for NASA\\'s SPAN computer\\nnetwork. It was like the centre of a wheel, with a dozen spokes\\nbranching off--each leading to another SPAN site. All these places,\\nknown as tailsites, depended on the lab site for their connections\\ninto SPAN. When JPL pulled itself off the network, the tailsites went\\ndown too.\\n\\nIt was a serious problem for the people in the SPAN office back in\\nVirginia. To Ron Tencati, head of security for NASA SPAN, taking a\\nrouting centre off-line was a major issue. But his hands were tied.\\nThe SPAN office exercised central authority over the wide area\\nnetwork, but it couldn\\'t dictate how individual field centres dealt\\nwith the worm. That was each centre\\'s own decision. The SPAN team\\ncould only give them advice and rush to develop a way to poison the\\nworm.\\n\\nThe SPAN office called John McMahon again, this time with a more\\nurgent request. Would he come over to help handle the crisis?\\n\\nThe SPAN centre was only 800 metres away from McMahon\\'s office. His\\nboss, Jerome Bennett, the DECNET protocol manager, gave the nod.\\nMcMahon would be on loan until the crisis was under control.\\n\\nWhen he got to Building 26, home of the NASA SPAN project office,\\nMcMahon became part of a core NASA crisis team including Todd Butler,\\nRon Tencati and Pat Sisson. Other key NASA people jumped in when\\nneeded, such as Dave Peters and Dave Stern. Jim Green, the head of the\\nNational Space Science Data Center at Goddard and the absolute boss of\\nSPAN, wanted hourly reports on the crisis. At first the core team\\nseemed only to include NASA people and to be largely based at Goddard.\\nBut as the day wore on, new people from other parts of the US\\ngovernment would join the team.\\n\\nThe worm had spread outside NASA.\\n\\nIt had also attacked the US Department of Energy\\'s worldwide\\nHigh-Energy Physics\\' Network of computers. Known as HEPNET, it was\\nanother piece of the overall SPAN network, along with Euro-HEPNET and\\nEuro-SPAN. The NASA and DOE computer networks of DEC computers\\ncrisscrossed at a number of places. A research laboratory might, for\\nexample, need to have access to computers from both HEPNET and NASA\\nSPAN. For convenience, the lab might just connect the two networks.\\nThe effect as far as the worm was concerned was that NASA\\'s SPAN and\\nDOE\\'s HEPNET were in fact just one giant computer network, all of\\nwhich the worm could invade.\\n\\nThe Department of Energy keeps classified information on its\\ncomputers. Very classified information. There are two groups in DOE:\\nthe people who do research on civilian energy projects and the people\\nwho make atomic bombs. So DOE takes security seriously, as in `threat\\nto national security\\' seriously. Although HEPNET wasn\\'t meant to be\\ncarrying any classified information across its wires, DOE responded\\nwith military efficiency when its computer managers discovered the\\ninvader. They grabbed the one guy who knew a lot about computer\\nsecurity on VMS systems and put him on the case: Kevin Oberman.\\n\\nLike McMahon, Oberman wasn\\'t formally part of the computer security\\nstaff. He had simply become interested in computer security and was\\nknown in-house as someone who knew about VMS systems and security.\\nOfficially, his job was network manager for the engineering department\\nat the DOE-financed Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, or LLNL,\\nnear San Francisco.\\n\\nLLNL conducted mostly military research, much of it for the Strategic\\nDefense Initiative. Many LLNL scientists spent their days designing\\nnuclear arms and developing beam weapons for the Star Wars program.9\\nDOE already had a computer security group, known as CIAC, the Computer\\nIncident Advisory Capability. But the CIAC team tended to be experts\\nin security issues surrounding Unix rather than VMS-based computer\\nsystems and networks. `Because there had been very few security\\nproblems over the years with VMS,\\' Oberman concluded, `they had never\\nbrought in anybody who knew about VMS and it wasn\\'t something they\\nwere terribly concerned with at the time.\\'\\n\\nThe worm shattered that peaceful confidence in VMS computers. Even as\\nthe W**K worm coursed through NASA, it was launching an aggressive\\nattack on DOE\\'s Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, near Chicago. It\\nhad broken into a number of computer systems there and the Fermilab\\npeople were not happy. They called in CIAC, who contacted Oberman with\\nan early morning phone call on 16 October. They wanted him to analyse\\nthe W**K worm. They wanted to know how dangerous it was. Most of all,\\nthey wanted to know what to do about it.\\n\\nThe DOE people traced their first contact with the worm back to 14\\nOctober. Further, they hypothesised, the worm had actually been\\nlaunched the day before, on Friday the 13th. Such an inauspicious day\\nwould, in Oberman\\'s opinion, have been in keeping with the type of\\nhumour exhibited by the creator or creators of the worm.\\n\\nOberman began his own analysis of the worm, oblivious to the fact that\\n3200 kilometres away, on the other side of the continent, his colleague\\nand acquaintance John McMahon was doing exactly the same thing.\\n\\nEvery time McMahon answered a phone call from an irate NASA system or\\nnetwork manager, he tried to get a copy of the worm from the infected\\nmachine. He also asked for the logs from their computer systems. Which\\ncomputer had the worm come from? Which systems was it attacking from\\nthe infected site? In theory, the logs would allow the NASA team to\\nmap the worm\\'s trail. If the team could find the managers of those\\nsystems in the worm\\'s path, it could warn them of the impending\\ndanger. It could also alert the people who ran recently infected\\nsystems which had become launchpads for new worm attacks.\\n\\nThis wasn\\'t always possible. If the worm had taken over a computer and\\nwas still running on it, then the manager would only be able to trace\\nthe worm backward, not forward. More importantly, a lot of the\\nmanagers didn\\'t keep extensive logs on their computers.\\n\\nMcMahon had always felt it was important to gather lots of information\\nabout who was connecting to a computer. In his previous job, he had\\nmodified his machines so they collected as much security information\\nas possible about their connections to other computers.\\n\\nVMS computers came with a standard set of alarms, but McMahon didn\\'t\\nthink they were thorough enough. The VMS alarms tended to send a\\nmessage to the computer managers which amounted to, `Hi! You just got\\na network connection from here\\'. The modified alarm system said, `Hi!\\nYou just got a network connection from here. The person at the other\\nend is doing a file transfer\\' and any other bits and pieces of\\ninformation that McMahon\\'s computer could squeeze out of the other\\ncomputer. Unfortunately, a lot of other NASA computer and network\\nmanagers didn\\'t share this enthusiasm for audit logs. Many did not\\nkeep extensive records of who had been accessing their machines and\\nwhen, which made the job of chasing the worm much tougher.\\n\\nThe SPAN office was, however, trying to keep very good logs on which\\nNASA computers had succumbed to the worm. Every time a NASA manager\\ncalled to report a worm disturbance, one of the team members wrote\\ndown the details with paper and pen. The list, outlining the addresses\\nof the affected computers and detailed notations of the degree of\\ninfection, would also be recorded on a computer. But handwritten lists\\nwere a good safeguard. The worm couldn\\'t delete sheets of paper.\\n\\nWhen McMahon learned DOE was also under attack, he began checking in\\nwith them every three hours or so. The two groups swapped lists of\\ninfected computers by telephone because voice, like the handwritten\\nword, was a worm-free medium. `It was a kind of archaic system, but on\\nthe other hand we didn\\'t have to depend on the network being up,\\'\\nMcMahon said. `We needed to have some chain of communications which\\nwas not the same as the network being attacked.\\'\\n\\nA number of the NASA SPAN team members had developed contacts within\\ndifferent parts of DEC through the company\\'s users\\' society, DECUS.\\nThese contacts were to prove very helpful. It was easy to get lost in\\nthe bureaucracy of DEC, which employed more than 125000 people, posted\\na billion-dollar profit and declared revenues in excess of $12 billion\\nin 1989.10 Such an enormous and prestigious company would not want\\nto face a crisis such as the W**K worm, particularly in such a\\npublicly visible organisation like NASA. Whether or not the worm\\'s\\nsuccessful expedition could be blamed on DEC\\'s software was a moot\\npoint. Such a crisis was, well, undesirable. It just didn\\'t look good.\\nAnd it mightn\\'t look so good either if DEC just jumped into the fray.\\nIt might look like the company was in some way at fault.\\n\\nThings were different, however, if someone already had a relationship\\nwith a technical expert inside the company. It wasn\\'t like NASA\\nmanager cold-calling a DEC guy who sold a million dollars worth of\\nmachines to someone else in the agency six months ago. It was the NASA\\nguy calling the DEC guy he sat next to at the conference last month.\\nIt was a colleague the NASA manager chatted with now and again.\\n\\nJohn McMahon\\'s analysis suggested there were three versions of the W**K\\nworm. These versions, isolated from worm samples collected from the\\nnetwork, were very similar, but each contained a few subtle\\ndifferences. In McMahon\\'s view, these differences could not be explained\\nby the way the worm recreated itself at each site in order to\\nspread. But why would the creator of the worm release different\\nversions? Why not just write one version properly and fire it off? The\\nworm wasn\\'t just one incoming missile; it was a frenzied attack. It was\\ncoming from all directions, at all sorts of different levels within\\nNASA\\'s computers.\\n\\nMcMahon guessed that the worm\\'s designer had released the different\\nversions at slightly different times. Maybe the creator released the\\nworm, and then discovered a bug. He fiddled with the worm a bit to\\ncorrect the problem and then released it again. Maybe he didn\\'t like\\nthe way he had fixed the bug the first time, so he changed it a little\\nmore and released it a third time.\\n\\nIn northern California, Kevin Oberman came to a different conclusion.\\nHe believed there was in fact only one real version of the worm\\nspiralling through HEPNET and SPAN. The small variations in the\\ndifferent copies he dissected seemed to stem from the worm\\'s ability\\nto learn and change as it moved from computer to computer.\\n\\nMcMahon and Oberman weren\\'t the only detectives trying to decipher the\\nvarious manifestations of the worm. DEC was also examining the worm,\\nand with good reason. The W**K worm had invaded the corporation\\'s own\\nnetwork. It had been discovered snaking its way through DEC\\'s own\\nprivate computer network, Easynet, which connected DEC manufacturing\\nplants, sales offices and other company sites around the world. DEC\\nwas circumspect about discussing the matter publicly, but the Easynet\\nversion of the W**K worm was definitely distinct. It had a strange\\nline of code in it, a line missing from any other versions. The worm\\nwas under instructions to invade as many sites as it could, with one\\nexception. Under no circumstances was it to attack computers inside\\nDEC\\'s area 48. The NASA team mulled over this information. One of them\\nlooked up area 48. It was New Zealand.\\n\\nNew Zealand?\\n\\nThe NASA team were left scratching their heads. This attack was\\ngetting stranger by the minute. Just when it seemed that the SPAN team\\nmembers were travelling down the right path toward an answer at the\\ncentre of the maze of clues, they turned a corner and found themselves\\nhopelessly lost again. Then someone pointed out that New Zealand\\'s\\nworldwide claim to fame was that it was a nuclear-free zone.\\n\\nIn 1986, New Zealand announced it would refuse to admit to its ports\\nany US ships carrying nuclear arms or powered by nuclear energy. The\\nUS retaliated by formally suspending its security obligations to the\\nSouth Pacific nation. If an unfriendly country invaded New Zealand,\\nthe US would feel free to sit on its hands. The US also cancelled\\nintelligence sharing practices and joint military exercises.\\n\\nMany people in Australia and New Zealand thought the US had\\noverreacted. New Zealand hadn\\'t expelled the Americans; it had simply\\nrefused to allow its population to be exposed to nuclear arms or\\npower. In fact, New Zealand had continued to allow the Americans to\\nrun their spy base at Waihopai, even after the US suspension. The\\ncountry wasn\\'t anti-US, just anti-nuclear.\\n\\nAnd New Zealand had very good reason to be anti-nuclear. For years, it\\nhad put up with France testing nuclear weapons in the Pacific. Then in\\nJuly 1985 the French blew up the Greenpeace anti-nuclear protest ship\\nas it sat in Auckland harbour. The Rainbow Warrior was due to sail for\\nMururoa Atoll, the test site, when French secret agents bombed the\\nship, killing Greenpeace activist Fernando Pereira.\\n\\nFor weeks, France denied everything. When the truth came out--that\\nPresident Mitterand himself had known about the bombing plan--the\\nFrench were red-faced. Heads rolled. French Defence Minister Charles\\nHernu was forced to resign. Admiral Pierre Lacoste, director of\\nFrance\\'s intelligence and covert action bureau, was sacked. France\\napologised and paid $NZ13 million compensation in exchange for New\\nZealand handing back the two saboteurs, who had each been sentenced to\\nten years\\' prison in Auckland.\\n\\nAs part of the deal, France had promised to keep the agents\\nincarcerated for three years at the Hao atoll French military base.\\nBoth agents walked free by May 1988 after serving less than two years.\\nAfter her return to France, one of the agents, Captain Dominique\\nPrieur, was promoted to the rank of commandant.\\n\\nFinally, McMahon thought. Something that made sense. The exclusion of\\nNew Zealand appeared to underline the meaning of the worm\\'s political\\nmessage.\\n\\nWhen the W**K worm invaded a computer system, it had instructions to\\ncopy itself and send that copy out to other machines. It would slip\\nthrough the network and when it came upon a computer attached to the\\nnetwork, it would poke around looking for a way in. What it really\\nwanted was to score a computer account with privileges, but it would\\nsettle for a basic-level, user-level account.\\n\\nVMS systems have accounts with varying levels of privilege. A\\nhigh-privilege account holder might, for example, be able to read the\\nelectronic mail of another computer user or delete files from that\\nuser\\'s directory. He or she might also be allowed to create new\\ncomputer accounts on the system, or reactivate disabled accounts. A\\nprivileged account holder might also be able to change someone else\\'s\\npassword. The people who ran computer systems or networks needed\\naccounts with the highest level of privilege in order to keep the\\nsystem running smoothly. The worm specifically sought out these sorts\\nof accounts because its creator knew that was where the power lay.\\n\\nThe worm was smart, and it learned as it went along. As it traversed\\nthe network, it created a masterlist of commonly used account names.\\nFirst, it tried to copy the list of computer users from a system it\\nhad not yet penetrated. It wasn\\'t always able to do this, but often\\nthe system security was lax enough for it to be successful. The worm\\nthen compared that list to the list of users on its current host. When\\nit found a match--an account name common to both lists--the worm added\\nthat name to the masterlist it carried around inside it, making a note\\nto try that account when breaking into a new system in future.\\n\\nIt was a clever method of attack, for the worm\\'s creator knew that\\ncertain accounts with the highest privileges were likely to have\\nstandard names, common across different machines. Accounts with names\\nsuch as `SYSTEM\\', `DECNET\\' and `FIELD\\' with standard passwords such as\\n`SYSTEM\\' and `DECNET\\' were often built into a computer before it was\\nshipped from the manufacturer. If the receiving computer manager\\ndidn\\'t change the pre-programmed account and password, then his\\ncomputer would have a large security hole waiting to be exploited.\\n\\nThe worm\\'s creator could guess some of the names of these\\nmanufacturer\\'s accounts, but not all of them. By endowing the worm\\nwith an ability to learn, he gave it far more power. As the worm\\nspread, it became more and more intelligent. As it reproduced, its\\noffspring evolved into ever more advanced creatures, increasingly\\nsuccessful at breaking into new systems.\\n\\nWhen McMahon performed an autopsy on one of the worm\\'s progeny, he was\\nimpressed with what he found. Slicing the worm open and inspecting its\\nentrails, he discovered an extensive collection of generic privileged\\naccounts across the SPAN network. In fact, the worm wasn\\'t only picking\\nup the standard VMS privileged accounts; it had learned accounts common\\nto NASA but not necessarily to other VMS computers. For example, a lot\\nof NASA sites which ran a type of TCP/IP mailer that needed either a\\nPOSTMASTER or a MAILER account. John saw those names turn up inside the\\nworm\\'s progeny.\\n\\nEven if it only managed to break into an unprivileged account, the\\nworm would use the account as an incubator. The worm replicated and\\nthen attacked other computers in the network. As McMahon and the rest\\nof the SPAN team continued to pick apart the rest of the worm\\'s code\\nto figure out exactly what the creature would do if it got into a\\nfully privileged account, they found more evidence of the dark sense\\nof humour harboured by the hacker behind the worm. Part of the worm, a\\nsubroutine, was named `find f**ked\\'.\\n\\nThe SPAN team tried to give NASA managers calling in as much\\ninformation as they could about the worm. It was the best way to help\\ncomputer managers, isolated in their offices around the country, to\\nregain a sense of control over the crisis.\\n\\nLike all the SPAN team, McMahon tried to calm the callers down and\\nwalk them through a set a questions designed to determine the extent\\nof the worm\\'s control over their systems. First, he asked them what\\nsymptoms their systems were showing. In a crisis situation, when\\nyou\\'re holding a hammer, everything looks like a nail. McMahon wanted\\nto make sure that the problems on the system were in fact caused by\\nthe worm and not something else entirely.\\n\\nIf the only problem seemed to be mysterious comments flashing across\\nthe screen, McMahon concluded that the worm was probably harassing the\\nstaff on that computer from a neighbouring system which it had\\nsuccessfully invaded. The messages suggested that the recipients\\'\\naccounts had not been hijacked by the worm. Yet.\\n\\nVAX/VMS machines have a feature called Phone, which is useful for\\non-line communications. For example, a NASA scientist could `ring up\\'\\none of his colleagues on a different computer and have a friendly chat\\non-line. The chat session is live, but it is conducted by typing on\\nthe computer screen, not `voice\\'. The VMS Phone facility enabled the\\nworm to send messages to users. It would simply call them using the\\nphone protocol. But instead of starting a chat session, it sent them\\nstatements from what was later determined to be the aptly named\\nFortune Cookie file--a collection of 60 or so pre-programmed comments.\\n\\nIn some cases, where the worm was really bugging staff, McMahon told\\nthe manager at the other end of the phone to turn the computer\\'s Phone\\nfeature off. A few managers complained and McMahon gave them the\\nobvious ultimatum: choose Phone or peace. Most chose peace.\\n\\nWhen McMahon finished his preliminary analysis, he had good news and\\nbad news. The good news was that, contrary to what the worm was\\ntelling computer users all over NASA, it was not actually deleting\\ntheir files. It was just pretending to delete their data. One big\\npractical joke. To the creator of the worm anyway. To the NASA\\nscientists, just a headache and heartache. And occasionally a heart\\nattack.\\n\\nThe bad news was that, when the worm got control over a privileged\\naccount, it would help someone--presumably its creator--perpetrate an\\neven more serious break-in at NASA. The worm sought out the FIELD\\naccount created by the manufacturer and, if it had been turned off,\\ntried to reactivate the account and install the password FIELD. The\\nworm was also programmed to change the password for the standard\\naccount named DECNET to a random string of at least twelve characters.\\nIn short, the worm tried to pry open a backdoor to the system.\\n\\nThe worm sent information about accounts it had successfully broken\\ninto back to a type of electronic mailbox--an account called GEMPAK on\\nSPAN node 6.59. Presumably, the hacker who created the worm would\\ncheck the worm\\'s mailbox for information which he could use to break\\ninto the NASA account at a later date. Not surprisingly, the mailboxes\\nhad been surreptitiously `borrowed\\' by the hacker, much to the\\nsurprise of the legitimate owners.\\n\\nA computer hacker created a whole new set of problems. Although the\\nworm was able to break into new accounts with greater speed and reach\\nthan a single hacker, it was more predictable. Once the SPAN and DOE\\nteams picked the worm apart, they would know exactly what it could be\\nexpected to do. However, a hacker was utterly unpredictable.\\n\\nMcMahon realised that killing off the worm was not going to solve the\\nproblem. All the system managers across the NASA and DOE networks\\nwould have to change all the passwords of the accounts used by the\\nworm. They would also have to check every system the worm had invaded\\nto see if it had built a backdoor for the hacker. The system admin had\\nto shut and lock all the backdoors, no small feat.\\n\\nWhat really scared the SPAN team about the worm, however, was that it\\nwas rampaging through NASA simply by using the simplest of attack\\nstrategies: username equals password. It was getting complete control\\nover NASA computers simply by trying a password which was identical to\\nthe name of the computer user\\'s account.\\n\\nThe SPAN team didn\\'t want to believe it, but the evidence was\\noverwhelming.\\n\\nTodd Butler answered a call from one NASA site. It was a gloomy call.\\nHe hung up.\\n\\n`That node just got hit,\\' he told the team.\\n\\n`How bad?\\' McMahon asked.\\n\\n`A privileged account.\\'\\n\\n`Oh boy.\\' McMahon jumped onto one of the terminals and did a SET HOST,\\nlogging into the remote NASA site\\'s machine. Bang. Up it came. `Your\\nsystem has officially been W**KED.\\'\\n\\nMcMahon turned to Butler. `What account did it get into?\\'\\n\\n`They think it was SYSTEM.\\'\\n\\nThe tension quietly rolled into black humour. The team couldn\\'t help\\nit. The head-slapping stupidity of the situation could only be viewed\\nas black comedy.\\n\\nThe NASA site had a password of SYSTEM for their fully privileged\\nSYSTEM account. It was so unforgivable. NASA, potentially the greatest\\nsingle collection of technical minds on Earth, had such lax computer\\nsecurity that a computer-literate teenager could have cracked it wide\\nopen. The tall poppy was being cut down to size by a computer program\\nresembling a bowl of spaghetti.\\n\\nThe first thing any computer system manager learns in Computer\\nSecurity 101 is never to use the same password as the username. It was\\nbad enough that naive users might fall into this trap ... but a\\ncomputer system manager with a fully privileged account.\\n\\nWas the hacker behind the worm malevolent? Probably not. If its\\ncreator had wanted to, he could have programmed the W**K worm to\\nobliterate NASA\\'s files. It could have razed everything in sight.\\n\\nIn fact, the worm was less infectious than its author appeared to\\ndesire. The W**K worm had been instructed to perform\\nseveral tasks which it didn\\'t execute. Important parts of the worm\\nsimply didn\\'t work. McMahon believed this failure to be accidental.\\nFor example, his analysis showed the worm was programmed to break into\\naccounts by trying no password, if the account holder had left the\\npassword blank. When he disassembled the worm, however, he found that\\npart of the program didn\\'t work properly.\\n\\nNonetheless, the fragmented and partly dysfunctional W**K worm was\\ncausing a major crisis inside several US government agencies. The\\nthing which really worried John was thinking about what a seasoned DCL\\nprogrammer with years of VMS experience could do with such a worm.\\nSomeone like that could do a lot of malicious damage. And what if the\\nW**K worm was just a dry run for something more serious down the\\ntrack? It was scary to contemplate.\\n\\nEven though the W**K worm did not seem to be intentionally evil, the\\nSPAN team faced some tough times. McMahon\\'s analysis turned up yet\\nmore alarming aspects to the worm. If it managed to break into the\\nSYSTEM account, a privileged account, it would block all electronic\\nmail deliveries to the system administrator. The SPAN office would not\\nbe able to send electronic warnings or advice on how to deal with the\\nworm to systems which had already been seized. This problem was\\nexacerbated by the lack of good information available to the project\\noffice on which systems were connected to SPAN. The only way to help\\npeople fighting this bushfire was to telephone them, but in many\\ninstances the main SPAN office didn\\'t know who to call. The SPAN team\\ncould only hope that those administrators who had the phone number of\\nSPAN headquarters pinned up near their computers would call when their\\ncomputers came under attack.\\n\\nMcMahon\\'s preliminary report outlined how much damage the worm could\\ndo in its own right. But it was impossible to measure how much damage\\nhuman managers would do to their own systems because of the worm.\\n\\nOne frantic computer manager who phoned the SPAN office refused to\\nbelieve John\\'s analysis that the worm only pretended to erase data. He\\nclaimed that the worm had not only attacked his system, it had\\ndestroyed it. `He just didn\\'t believe us when we told him that the\\nworm was mostly a set of practical jokes,\\' McMahon said. `He\\nreinitialised his system.\\' `Reinitialised\\' as in started up his system\\nwith a clean slate. As in deleted everything on the infected\\ncomputer--all the NASA staff\\'s data gone. He actually did what the\\nworm only pretended to do.\\n\\nThe sad irony was that the SPAN team never even got a copy of the data\\nfrom the manager\\'s system. They were never able to confirm that his\\nmachine had even been infected.\\n\\nAll afternoon McMahon moved back and forth between answering the\\never-ringing SPAN phone and writing up NASA\\'s analysis of the worm. He\\nhad posted a cryptic electronic message about the attack across the\\nnetwork, and Kevin Oberman had read it. The message had to be\\ncircumspect since no-one knew if the creator of the W**K worm was in\\nfact on the network, watching, waiting. A short time later, McMahon\\nand Oberman were on the phone together--voice--sharing their ideas and\\ncross-checking their analysis.\\n\\nThe situation was discouraging. Even if McMahon and Oberman managed to\\ndevelop a successful program to kill off the worm, the NASA SPAN team\\nfaced another daunting task. Getting the worm-killer out to all the\\nNASA sites was going to be much harder than expected because there was\\nno clear, updated map of the SPAN network. Much of NASA didn\\'t like\\nthe idea of a centralised map of the SPAN system. McMahon recalled\\nthat, some time before the W**K worm attack, a manager had tried to\\nmap the system. His efforts had accidentally tripped so many system\\nalarms that he was quietly taken aside and told not to do it again.\\n\\nThe result was that in instances where the team had phone contact\\ndetails for managers, the information was often outdated.\\n\\n`No, he used to work here, but he left over a year ago.\\'\\n\\n`No, we don\\'t have a telephone tree of people to ring if\\nsomething goes wrong with our computers. There are a whole\\nbunch of people in different places here who handle the\\ncomputers.\\'\\n\\nThis is what John often heard at the other end of the phone.\\n\\nThe network had grown into a rambling hodgepodge for which there was\\nlittle central coordination. Worse, a number of computers at different\\nNASA centres across the US had just been tacked onto SPAN without\\ntelling the main office at Goddard. People were calling up the ad-hoc\\ncrisis centre from computer nodes on the network which didn\\'t even\\nhave names. These people had been practising a philosophy known in\\ncomputer security circles as `security through obscurity\\'. They\\nfigured that if no-one knew their computer system existed--if it\\ndidn\\'t have a name, if it wasn\\'t on any list or map of the SPAN\\nnetwork--then it would be protected from hackers and other computer\\nenemies.\\n\\nMcMahon handled a number of phone calls from system managers saying,\\n`There is something strange happening in my system here\\'. John\\'s most\\nbasic question was, `Where is \"here\"?\\' And of course if the SPAN\\noffice didn\\'t know those computer systems existed, it was a lot harder\\nto warn their managers about the worm. Or tell them how to protect\\nthemselves. Or give them a worm-killing program once it was developed.\\nOr help them seal up breached accounts which the worm was feeding back\\nto its creator.\\n\\nIt was such a mess. At times, McMahon sat back and considered who\\nmight have created this worm. The thing almost looked as though it had\\nbeen released before it was finished. Its author or authors seemed to\\nhave a good collection of interesting ideas about how to solve\\nproblems, but they were never properly completed. The worm included a\\nroutine for modifying its attack strategy, but the thing was never\\nfully developed. The worm\\'s code didn\\'t have enough error handling in\\nit to ensure the creature\\'s survival for long periods of time. And the\\nworm didn\\'t send the addresses of the accounts it had successfully\\nbreached back to the mailbox along with the password and account name.\\nThat was really weird. What use was a password and account name\\nwithout knowing what computer system to use it on?\\n\\nOn the other hand, maybe the creator had done this deliberately. Maybe\\nhe had wanted to show the world just how many computers the worm could\\nsuccessfully penetrate. The worm\\'s mail-back program would do this.\\nHowever, including the address of each infected site would have made\\nthe admins\\' jobs easier. They could simply have used the GEMPAK\\ncollection as a hitlist of infected sites which needed to be\\nde-wormed. The possible theories were endless.\\n\\nThere were some points of brilliance in the worm, some things that\\nMcMahon had never considered, which was impressive since he knew a lot\\nabout how to break into VMS computers. There was also considerable\\ncreativity, but there wasn\\'t any consistency. After the worm incident,\\nvarious computer security experts would hypothesise that the W**K worm\\nhad in fact been written by more than one person. But McMahon\\nmaintained his view that it was the work of a single hacker.\\n\\nIt was as if the creator of the worm started to pursue an idea and\\nthen got sidetracked or interrupted. Suddenly he just stopped writing\\ncode to implement that idea and started down another path, never again\\nto reach the end. The thing had a schizophrenic structure. It was all\\nover the place.\\n\\nMcMahon wondered if the author had done this on purpose, to make it\\nharder to figure out exactly what the worm was capable of doing.\\nPerhaps, he thought, the code had once been nice and linear and it all\\nmade sense. Then the author chopped it to pieces, moved the middle to\\nthe top, the top to the bottom, scrambled up the chunks and strung\\nthem all together with a bunch of `GO TO\\' commands. Maybe the hacker\\nwho wrote the worm was in fact a very elegant DCL programmer who\\nwanted the worm to be chaotic in order to protect it. Security through\\nobscurity.\\n\\nOberman maintained a different view. He believed the programming style\\nvaried so much in different parts that it had to be the product of a\\nnumber of people. He knew that when computer programmers write code\\nthey don\\'t make lots of odd little changes in style for no particular\\nreason.\\n\\nKevin Oberman and John McMahon bounced ideas off one another. Both had\\ndeveloped their own analyses. Oberman also brought Mark Kaletka, who\\nmanaged internal networking at Fermilab, one of HEPNET\\'s largest\\nsites, into the cross-checking process. The worm had a number of\\nserious vulnerabilities, but the problem was finding one, and quickly,\\nwhich could be used to wipe it out with minimum impact on the besieged\\ncomputers.\\n\\nWhenever a VMS machine starts up an activity, the computer gives it a\\nunique process name. When the worm burrowed into a computer site, one\\nof the first things it did was check that another copy of itself was\\nnot already running on that computer. It did this by checking for its\\nown process names. The worm\\'s processes were all called NETW_ followed\\nby a random, four-digit number. If the incoming worm found this\\nprocess name, it assumed another copy of itself was already running on\\nthe computer, so it destroyed itself.\\n\\nThe answer seemed to be a decoy duck. Write a program which pretended\\nto be the worm and install it across all of NASA\\'s vulnerable\\ncomputers. The first anti-W**K program did just that. It quietly sat\\non the SPAN computers all day long, posing as a NETW_ process, faking\\nout any real version of the W**K worm which should come along.\\n\\nOberman completed an anti-W**K program first and ran it by McMahon. It\\nworked well, but McMahon noticed one large flaw. Oberman\\'s program\\nchecked for the NETW_ process name, but it assumed that the worm was\\nrunning under the SYSTEM group. In most cases, this was true, but it\\ndidn\\'t have to be. If the worm was running in another group, Oberman\\'s\\nprogram would be useless. When McMahon pointed out the flaw, Oberman\\nthought, God, how did I miss that?\\n\\nMcMahon worked up his own version of an anti-W**K\\nprogram, based on Oberman\\'s program, in preparation for releasing it\\nto NASA.\\n\\nAt the same time, Oberman revised his anti-W**K program for DOE. By\\nMonday night US Eastern Standard Time, Oberman was able to send out an\\nearly copy of a vaccine designed to protect computers which hadn\\'t\\nbeen infected yet, along with an electronic warning about the worm.\\nHis first electronic warning, distributed by CIAC, said in part:\\n\\nTHE COMPUTER INCIDENT ADVISORY CAPABILITY C I A C\\n\\nADVISORY NOTICE\\n\\nThe W.COM Worm affecting VAX VMS Systems\\n\\nOctober 16, 1989 18:37 PSTNumber A-2\\n\\nThis is a mean bug to kill and could have done a lot of damage.\\n\\nSince it notifies (by mail) someone of each successful penetration and\\nleaves a trapdoor (the FIELD account), just killing the bug is not\\nadequate.

It is unclear if the spread of the worm has been checked.\\nIt may spread to other systems such as DOE\\'s HEPNET within a few days.\\nVMS system managers should prepare now.\\n\\nThe worm targets VMS machines, and can only be propagated via DECnet.\\nThe worm exploits two features of DECnet/VMS in order to propagate\\nitself. The first is the default DECnet account, which is a facility\\nfor users who don\\'t have a specific login ID for a machine to have\\nsome degree of anonymous access. It uses the default DECnet account to\\ncopy itself to a machine, and then uses the `TASK 0\\' feature of DECnet\\nto invoke the remote copy. It has several other features including a\\nbrute force attack.\\n\\nOnce the worm has successfully penetrated your system it will infect\\n.COM files and create new security vulnerabilities. It then seems to\\nbroadcast these vulnerabilities to the outside world. It may also\\ndamage files as well, either unintentionally or otherwise.\\n\\nAn analysis of the worm appears below and is provided by R. Kevin\\nOberman of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Included with the\\nanalysis is a DCL program that will block the current version of the\\nworm. At least two versions of this worm exist and more may be\\ncreated. This program should give you enough time to close up obvious\\nsecurity holes. A more thorough DCL program is being written.\\n\\nIf your site could be affected please call CIAC for more details...\\n\\nReport on the W.COM worm.\\n\\nR. Kevin Oberman\\n\\nEngineering Department\\n\\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory\\n\\nOctober 16, 1989\\n\\nThe following describes the action of the W.COM worm (currently based\\non the examination of the first two incarnations). The replication\\ntechnique causes the code to be modified slightly which indicates the\\nsource of the attack and learned information.\\n\\nAll analysis was done with more haste than I care for, but I believe I\\nhave all of the basic facts correct. First a description of the\\nprogram:\\n\\n1. The program assures that it is working in a directory to which the\\nowner (itself) has full access (Read, Write, Execute, and Delete).\\n\\n2. The program checks to see if another copy is still running. It\\nlooks for a process with the first 5 characters of `NETW_\\'. If such is\\nfound, it deletes itself (the file) and stops its process.\\n\\nNOTE\\n\\nA quick check for infection is to look for a process name starting\\nwith `NETW_\\'. This may be done with a SHOW PROCESS command.\\n\\n3. The program then changes the default DECNET account password to a\\nrandom string of at least 12 characters.\\n\\n4. Information on the password used to access the system is mailed to\\nthe user GEMTOP on SPAN node 6.59. Some versions may have a different\\naddress.11\\n\\n5. The process changes its name to `NETW_\\' followed by a random\\nnumber.\\n\\n6. It then checks to see if it has SYSNAM priv. If so, it defines the\\nsystem announcement message to be the banner in the program:\\n\\n        Worms Against Nuclear Killers!\\n\\nYour System Has Been Officically W**Ked.\\n\\n You talk of times of peace for all, and then prepare for war.\\n\\n7. If it has SYSPRV, it disables mail to the SYSTEM account.\\n\\n8. If it has SYSPRV, it modifies the system login command procedure to\\nAPPEAR to delete all of a user\\'s file. (It really does nothing.)\\n\\n9. The program then scans the account\\'s logical name table for command\\nprocedures and tries to modify the FIELD account to a known password\\nwith login from any source and all privs. This is a primitive virus,\\nbut very effective IF it should get into a privileged account.\\n\\n10. It proceeds to attempt to access other systems by picking node\\nnumbers at random. It then uses PHONE to get a list of active users on\\nthe remote system. It proceeds to irritate them by using PHONE to ring\\nthem.\\n\\n11. The program then tries to access the RIGHTSLIST file and attempts\\nto access some remote system using the users found and a list of\\n`standard\\' users included within the worm. It looks for passwords\\nwhich are the same as that of the account or are blank. It records all\\nsuch accounts.\\n\\n12. It looks for an account that has access to SYSUAF.DAT.\\n\\n13. If a priv. account is found, the program is copied to that account\\nand started. If no priv. account was found, it is copied to other\\naccounts found on the random system.\\n\\n14. As soon as it finishes with a system, it picks another random\\nsystem and repeats (forever).\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\n1. The following program will block the worm. Extract the following\\ncode and execute it. It will use minimal resources. It creates a\\nprocess named NETW_BLOCK which will prevent the worm from running.\\n\\nEditors note: This fix will work only with this version of the worm.\\n\\nMutated worms will require modification of this code; however, this\\nprogram should prevent the worm from running long enough to secure\\nyour system from the worms attacks.13\\n\\n                                    ---\\n\\nMcMahon\\'s version of an anti-W**K program was also ready to go by late\\nMonday, but he would face delays getting it out to NASA. Working inside\\nNASA was a balancing act, a delicate ballet demanding exquisite\\nchoreography between getting the job done, following official procedures\\nand avoiding steps which might tread on senior bureaucrats\\' toes. It was\\nseveral days before NASA\\'s anti-W**K program was officially released.\\n\\nDOE was not without its share of problems in launching the anti-W**K\\nprogram and advisory across HEPNET. At 5.04 p.m. Pacific Coast Time on\\n17 October, as Oberman put the final touches on the last paragraph of\\nhis final report on the worm, the floor beneath his feet began to\\nshake. The building was trembling. Kevin Oberman was in the middle of\\nthe 1989 San Francisco earthquake.\\n\\nMeasuring 7.1 on the Richter scale, the Loma Prieta earthquake ripped\\nthrough the greater San Francisco area with savage speed. Inside the\\ncomputer lab, Oberman braced himself for the worst. Once the shaking\\nstopped and he ascertained the computer centre was still standing, he\\nsat back down at his terminal. With the PA blaring warnings for all\\nnon-essential personnel to leave the building immediately, Oberman\\nrushed off the last sentence of the report. He paused and then added a\\npostscript saying that if the paragraph didn\\'t make sense, it was\\nbecause he was a little rattled by the large earthquake which had just\\nhit Lawrence Livermore Labs. He pressed the key, sent out his final\\nanti-W**K report and fled the building.\\n\\nBack on the east coast, the SPAN office continued to help people\\ncalling from NASA sites which had been hit. The list of sites which\\nhad reported worm-related problems grew steadily during the week.\\nOfficial estimates on the scope of the W**K worm attack were vague,\\nbut trade journals such as Network World and Computerworld quoted the\\nspace agency as suffering only a small number of successful worm\\ninvasions, perhaps 60 VMS-based computers. SPAN security manager Ron\\nTencati estimated only 20 successful worm penetrations in the NASA\\npart of SPAN\\'s network, but another internal estimate put the figure\\nmuch higher: 250 to 300 machines. Each of those computers might have\\nhad 100 or more users. Figures were sketchy, but virtually everyone on\\nthe network--all 270000 computer accounts--had been affected by the\\nworm, either because their part of the network had been pulled\\noff-line or because their machines had been harassed by the W**K worm\\nas it tried again and again to login from an infected machine. By the\\nend of the worm attack, the SPAN office had accumulated a list of\\naffected sites which ran over two columns on several computer screens.\\nEach of them had lodged some form of complaint about the worm.\\n\\nAlso by the end of the crisis, NASA and DOE computer network managers\\nhad their choice of vaccines, antidotes and blood tests for the W**K\\nworm. McMahon had released ANTIW**K.COM, a program which killed the\\nworm and vaccinated a system against further attacks, and\\nWORM-INFO.TEXT, which provided a list of worm-infestation symptoms.\\nOberman\\'s program, called [.SECURITY]CHECK_SYSTEM.COM, checked for all\\nthe security flaws used by the worm to sneak into a computer system.\\nDEC also had a patch to cover the security hole in the DECNET account.\\n\\nWhatever the real number of infected machines, the worm had certainly\\ncircumnavigated the globe. It had reach into European sites, such as\\nCERN--formerly known as the European Centre for Nuclear Research--in\\nSwitzerland, through to Goddard\\'s computers in Maryland, on to\\nFermilab in Chicago and propelled itself across the Pacific into the\\nRiken Accelerator Facility in Japan.14\\n\\nNASA officials told the media they believed the worm had been launched\\nabout 4.30 a.m. on Monday, 16 October.15 They also believed it had\\noriginated in Europe, possibly in France.\\n\\n\\nWednesday, 18 October 1989\\nKennedy Space Center, Florida\\n\\nThe five-member Atlantis had some bad news on Wednesday morning. The\\nweather forecasters gave the launch site a 40 per cent chance of\\nlaunch guideline-violating rain and cloud. And then there was the\\nearthquake in California.\\n\\nThe Kennedy Space Center wasn\\'t the only place which had to be in\\ntip-top working order for a launch to go ahead. The launch depended on\\nmany sites far away from Florida. These included Edwards Air Force\\nBase in California, where the shuttle was due to land on Monday. They\\nalso included other sites, often military bases, which were essential\\nfor shuttle tracking and other mission support. One of these sites was\\na tracking station at Onizuka Air Force Base at Sunnyvale, California.\\nThe earthquake which ripped through the Bay area had damaged the\\ntracking station and senior NASA decision-makers planned to meet on\\nWednesday morning to consider the Sunnyvale situation. Still, the\\nspace agency maintained a calm, cool exterior. Regardless of the\\ntechnical problems, the court challenges and the protesters, the\\nwhimsical weather, the natural disasters, and the W**K worm, NASA was\\nstill in control of the situation.\\n\\n`There\\'s been some damage, but we don\\'t know how much. The sense I get\\nis it\\'s fairly positive,\\' a NASA spokesman told UPI. `But there are\\nsome problems.\\'16 In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Rick Oborn\\nreassured the public again, `They are going to be able to handle\\nshuttle tracking and support for the mission ... They will be able to\\ndo their job\\'.17\\n\\nAtlantis waited, ready to go, at launchpad 39B. The technicians had\\nfilled the shuttle up with rocket fuel and it looked as if the weather\\nmight hold. It was partly cloudy, but conditions at Kennedy passed\\nmuster.\\n\\nThe astronauts boarded the shuttle. Everything was in place.\\n\\nBut while the weather was acceptable in Florida, it was causing some\\nproblems in Africa, the site of an emergency landing location. If it\\nwasn\\'t one thing, it was another. NASA ordered a four-minute delay.\\n\\nFinally at 12.54 p.m., Atlantis boomed from its launchpad. Rising up\\nfrom the Kennedy Center, streaking a trail of twin flames from its\\nhuge solid-fuel boosters, the shuttle reached above the atmosphere and\\ninto space.\\n\\nAt 7.15 p.m., exactly 6 hours and 21 minutes after lift-off, Galileo\\nbegan its solo journey into space. And at 8.15 p.m., Galileo\\'s booster\\nignited.\\n\\nInside shuttle mission control, NASA spokesman Brian Welch announced,\\n`The spacecraft Galileo ... has achieved Earth escape velocity\\'.18\\n\\n\\nMonday, 30 October 1989\\nNASA\\'s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland\\n\\nThe week starting 16 October had been a long one for the SPAN team.\\nThey were keeping twelve-hour days and dealing with hysterical people\\nall day long. Still, they managed to get copies of anti-W**K out,\\ndespite the limitations of the dated SPAN records and the paucity of\\ngood logs allowing them to retrace the worm\\'s path. `What we learned\\nthat week was just how much data is not collected,\\' McMahon observed.\\n\\nBy Friday, 20 October, there were no new reports of worm attacks. It\\nlooked as though the crisis had passed. Things could be tidied up by\\nthe rest of the SPAN team and McMahon returned to his own work.\\n\\nA week passed. All the while, though, McMahon was on edge. He doubted\\nthat someone who had gone to all that trouble of creating the W**K\\nworm would let his baby be exterminated so quickly. The decoy-duck\\nstrategy only worked as long as the worm kept the same process name,\\nand as long as it was programmed not to activate itself on systems\\nwhich were already infected. Change the process name, or teach the\\nworm to not to suicide, and the SPAN team would face another, larger\\nproblem. John McMahon had an instinct about the worm; it might just\\nbe back.\\n\\nHis instinct was right.\\n\\nThe following Monday, McMahon received another phone call from the\\nSPAN project office. When he poked his head in his boss\\'s office,\\nJerome Bennett looked up from his desk.\\n\\n`The thing is back,\\' McMahon told him. There was no need to explain\\nwhat `the thing\\' was. `I\\'m going over to the SPAN office.\\'\\n\\nRon Tencati and Todd Butler had a copy of the new W**K worm ready for\\nMcMahon. This version of the worm was far more virulent. It copied\\nitself more effectively and therefore moved through the network much\\nfaster. The revised worm\\'s penetration rate was much higher--more than\\nfour times greater than the version of W**K released in the first\\nattack. The phone was ringing off the hook again. John took a call\\nfrom one irate manager who launched into a tirade. `I ran your\\nanti-W**K program, followed your instructions to the letter, and look\\nwhat happened!\\'\\n\\nThe worm had changed its process name. It was also designed to hunt down\\nand kill the decoy-duck program. In fact, the SPAN network was going to\\nturn into a rather bloody battlefield. This worm didn\\'t just kill the\\ndecoy, it also killed any other copy of the W**K worm. Even if McMahon\\nchanged the process name used by his program, the decoy-duck strategy\\nwas not going to work any longer.\\n\\nThere were other disturbing improvements to the new version of the\\nW**K worm. Preliminary information suggested it changed the password\\non any account it got into. This was a problem. But not nearly as big\\na problem as if the passwords it changed were for the only privileged\\naccounts on the system. The new worm was capable of locking a system\\nmanager out of his or her own system.\\n\\nPrevented from getting into his own account, the computer manager\\nmight try borrowing the account of an average user, call him Edwin.\\nUnfortunately, Edwin\\'s account probably only had low-level privileges.\\nEven in the hands of a skilful computer manager, the powers granted to\\nEdwin\\'s account were likely too limited to eradicate the worm from its\\nnewly elevated status as computer manager. The manager might spend his\\nwhole morning matching wits with the worm from the disadvantaged\\nposition of a normal user\\'s account. At some point he would have to\\nmake the tough decision of last resort: turn the entire computer\\nsystem off.\\n\\nThe manager would have to conduct a forced reboot of the machine. Take\\nit down, then bring it back up on minimum configuration. Break back\\ninto it. Fix the password which the worm had changed. Logout. Reset\\nsome variables. Reboot the machine again. Close up any underlying\\nsecurity holes left behind by the worm. Change any passwords which\\nmatched users\\' names. A cold start of a large VMS machine took time.\\nAll the while, the astronomers, physicists and engineers who worked in\\nthis NASA office wouldn\\'t be able to work on their computers.\\n\\nAt least the SPAN team was better prepared for the worm this time.\\nThey had braced themselves psychologically for a possible return\\nattack. Contact information for the network had been updated. And the\\ngeneral DECNET internet community was aware of the worm and was\\nlending a hand wherever possible.\\n\\nHelp came from a system manager in France, a country which seemed to\\nbe of special interest to the worm\\'s author. The manager, Bernard\\nPerrot of Institut de Physique Nucleaire in Orsay, had obtained a copy\\nof the worm, inspected it and took special notice of the creature\\'s\\npoor error checking ability. This was the worm\\'s true Achilles\\' heel.\\n\\nThe worm was trained to go after the RIGHTSLIST database, the list of\\nall the people who have accounts on the computer. What if someone\\nmoved the database by renaming it and put a dummy database in its\\nplace? The worm would, in theory, go after the dummy, which could be\\ndesigned with a hidden bomb. When the worm sniffed out the dummy, and\\nlatched onto it, the creature would explode and die. If it worked, the\\nSPAN team would not have to depend on the worm killing itself, as they\\nhad during the first invasion. They would have the satisfaction of\\ndestroying the thing themselves.\\n\\nRon Tencati procured a copy of the French manager\\'s worm-killing\\nprogram and gave it to McMahon, who set up a sort of mini-laboratory\\nexperiment. He cut the worm into pieces and extracted the relevant\\nbits. This allowed him to test the French worm-killing program with\\nlittle risk of the worm escaping and doing damage. The French program\\nworked wonderfully. Out it went. The second version of the worm was so\\nmuch more virulent, getting it out of SPAN was going to take\\nconsiderably longer than the first time around. Finally, almost two\\nweeks after the second onslaught, the W**K worm had been eradicated\\nfrom SPAN.\\n\\nBy McMahon\\'s estimate, the W**K worm had incurred up to half a million\\ndollars in costs. Most of these were through people wasting time and\\nresources chasing the worm instead of doing their normal jobs. The\\nworm was, in his view, a crime of theft. `People\\'s time and resources\\nhad been wasted,\\' he said. `The theft was not the result of the\\naccident. This was someone who deliberately went out to make a mess.\\n\\n`In general, I support prosecuting people who think breaking into\\nmachines is fun. People like that don\\'t seem to understand what kind\\nof side effects that kind of fooling around has. They think that\\nbreaking into a machine and not touching anything doesn\\'t do anything.\\nThat is not true. You end up wasting people\\'s time. People are dragged\\ninto the office at strange hours. Reports have to be written. A lot of\\nyelling and screaming occurs. You have to deal with law enforcement.\\nThese are all side effects of someone going for a joy ride in someone\\nelse\\'s system, even if they don\\'t do any damage. Someone has to pay\\nthe price.\\'\\n\\nMcMahon never found out who created the W**K worm. Nor did he ever\\ndiscover what he intended to prove by releasing it. The creator\\'s\\nmotives were never clear and, if it had been politically inspired,\\nno-one took credit.\\n\\nThe W**K worm left a number of unanswered questions in its wake, a\\nnumber of loose ends which still puzzle John McMahon. Was the hacker\\nbehind the worm really protesting against NASA\\'s launch of the\\nplutonium-powered Galileo space probe? Did the use of the word\\n`W**K\\'--a most un-American word--mean the hacker wasn\\'t American? Why\\nhad the creator recreated the worm and released it a second time? Why\\nhad no-one, no political or other group, claimed responsibility for\\nthe W**K worm?\\n\\nOne of the many details which remained an enigma was contained in the\\nversion of the worm used in the second attack. The worm\\'s creator had\\nreplaced the original process name, NETW_, with a new one, presumably\\nto thwart the anti-W**K program. McMahon figured the original process\\nname stood for `netW**K\\'--a reasonable guess at the hacker\\'s intended\\nmeaning. The new process name, however, left everyone on the SPAN team\\nscratching their heads: it didn\\'t seem to stand for anything. The\\nletters formed an unlikely set of initials for someone\\'s name. No-one\\nrecognised it as an acronym for a saying or an organisation. And it\\ncertainly wasn\\'t a proper word in the English language. It was a\\ncomplete mystery why the creator of the W**K worm, the hacker who\\nlaunched an invasion into hundreds of NASA and DOE computers, should\\nchoose this weird word.\\n\\nThe word was `OILZ\\'.\\n\\n                        *Chapter 2 -- The Corner Pub.\\n\\n\\nYou talk of times of peace for all; and then prepare for war.\\n\\n-- from `Blossom of Blood\\', Species Deceases.\\n\\nIt is not surprising the SPAN security team would miss the mark. It is\\nnot surprising, for example, that these officials should to this day\\nbe pronouncing the `Oilz\\' version of the W**K worm as `oil zee\\'. It is\\nalso not surprising that they hypothesised the worm\\'s creator chose\\nthe word `Oilz\\' because the modifications made to the last version\\nmade it slippery, perhaps even oily.\\n\\nLikely as not, only an Australian would see the worm\\'s link to the\\nlyrics of Midnight Oil.\\n\\nThis was the world\\'s first worm with a political message, and the\\nsecond major worm in the history of the worldwide computer networks.\\nIt was also the trigger for the creation of FIRST, the Forum of\\nIncident Response and Security Teams.2 FIRST was an international\\nsecurity alliance allowing governments, universities and commercial\\norganisations to share information about computer network security\\nincidents. Yet, NASA and the US Department of Energy were half a world\\naway from finding the creator of the W**K worm. Even as investigators\\nsniffed around electronic trails leading to France, it appears the\\nperpetrator was hiding behind his computer and modem in Australia.\\n\\nGeographically, Australia is a long way from anywhere. To Americans,\\nit conjures up images of fuzzy marsupials, not computer hackers.\\nAmerican computer security officials, like those at NASA and the US\\nDepartment of Energy, had other barriers as well. They function in a\\nworld of concretes, of appointments made and kept, of real names,\\nbusiness cards and official titles. The computer underground, by\\ncontrast, is a veiled world populated by characters slipping in and\\nout of the half-darkness. It is not a place where people use their\\nreal names. It is not a place where people give out real personal\\ndetails.\\n\\nIt is, in fact, not so much a place as a space. It is ephemeral,\\nintangible--a foggy labyrinth of unmapped, winding streets through\\nwhich one occasionally ascertains the contours of a fellow traveller.\\n\\nWhen Ron Tencati, the manager in charge of NASA SPAN security, realised\\nthat NASA\\'s computers were being attacked by an intruder, he rang the\\nFBI. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation\\'s Computer Crime Unit fired\\noff a stream of questions. How many computers had been attacked? Where\\nwere they? Who was behind the attack? The FBI told Tencati, `keep us\\ninformed of the situation\\'. Like the CIAC team in the Department of\\nEnergy, it appears the FBI didn\\'t have much knowledge of VMS, the\\nprimary computer operating system used in SPAN.\\n\\nBut the FBI knew enough to realise the worm attack was potentially\\nvery serious. The winding electronic trail pointed vaguely to a\\nforeign computer system and, before long, the US Secret Service was\\ninvolved. Then the French secret service, the Direction de la\\nSurveillance du Territoire, or DST, jumped into the fray.\\n\\nDST and the FBI began working together on the case. A casual observer\\nwith the benefit of hindsight might see different motivations driving\\nthe two government agencies. The FBI wanted to catch the perpetrator.\\nThe DST wanted to make it clear that the infamous W**K worm attack on\\nthe world\\'s most prestigious space agency did not originate in France.\\n\\nIn the best tradition of cloak-and-dagger government agencies, the FBI\\nand DST people established two communication channels--an official\\nchannel and an unofficial one. The official channel involved\\nembassies, attachÃ©s, formal communiques and interminable delays in\\ngetting answers to the simplest questions. The unofficial channel\\ninvolved a few phone calls and some fast answers.\\n\\nRon Tencati had a colleague named Chris on the SPAN network in France,\\nwhich was the largest user of SPAN in Europe. Chris was involved in\\nmore than just science computer networks. He had certain contacts in\\nthe French government and seemed to be involved in their computer\\nnetworks. So, when the FBI needed technical information for its\\ninvestigation--the kind of information likely to be sanitised by some\\nembassy bureaucrat--one of its agents rang up Ron Tencati. `Ron, ask\\nyour friend this,\\' the FBI would say. And Ron would.\\n\\n`Chris, the FBI wants to know this,\\' Tencati would tell his colleague\\non SPAN France. Then Chris would get the necessary information. He\\nwould call Tencati back, saying, `Ron, here is the answer. Now, the\\nDST wants to know that\\'. And off Ron would go in search of information\\nrequested by the DST.\\n\\nThe investigation proceeded in this way, with each helping the other\\nthrough backdoor channels. But the Americans\\' investigation was headed\\ntoward the inescapable conclusion that the attack on NASA had\\noriginated from a French computer. The worm may have simply travelled\\nthrough the French computer from yet another system, but the French\\nmachine appeared to be the sole point of infection for NASA.\\n\\nThe French did not like this outcome. Not one bit. There was no way\\nthat the worm had come from France. Ce n\\'est pas vrai.\\n\\nWord came back from the French that they were sure the worm had come\\nfrom the US. Why else would it have been programmed to mail details of\\nall computer accounts it penetrated around the world back to a US\\nmachine, the computer known as GEMPAK? Because the author of the worm\\nwas an American, of course! Therefore it is not our problem, the\\nFrench told the Americans. It is your problem.\\n\\nMost computer security experts know it is standard practice among\\nhackers to create the most tangled trail possible between the hacker\\nand the hacked. It makes it very difficult for people like the FBI to\\ntrace who did it. So it would be difficult to draw definite\\nconclusions about the nationality of the hacker from the location of a\\nhacker\\'s information drop-off point--a location the hacker no doubt\\nfigured would be investigated by the authorities almost immediately\\nafter the worm\\'s release.\\n\\nTencati had established the French connection from some computer logs\\nshowing NASA under attack very early on Monday, 16 October. The logs\\nwere important because they were relatively clear. As the worm had\\nprocreated during that day, it had forced computers all over the\\nnetwork to attack each other in ever greater numbers. By 11 a.m. it\\nwas almost impossible to tell where any one attack began and the other\\nended.\\n\\nSome time after the first attack, DST sent word that certain agents\\nwere going to be in Washington DC regarding other matters. They wanted\\na meeting with the FBI. A representative from the NASA Inspector\\nGeneral\\'s Office would attend the meeting, as would someone from NASA\\nSPAN security.\\n\\nTencati was sure he could show the W**K worm attack on NASA originated\\nin France. But he also knew he had to document everything, to have\\nexact answers to every question and counter-argument put forward by\\nthe French secret service agents at the FBI meeting. When he developed\\na timeline of attacks, he found that the GEMPAK machine showed X.25\\nnetwork connection, via another system, from a French computer around\\nthe same time as the W**K worm attack. He followed the scent and\\ncontacted the manager of that system. Would he help Tencati? Mais oui.\\nThe machine is at your disposal, Monsieur Tencati.\\n\\nTencati had never used an X.25 network before; it had a unique set of\\ncommands unlike any other type of computer communications network. He\\nwanted to retrace the steps of the worm, but he needed help. So he\\ncalled his friend Bob Lyons at DEC to walk him through the process.\\n\\nWhat Tencati found startled him. There were traces of the worm on the\\nmachine all right, the familiar pattern of login failures as the worm\\nattempted to break into different accounts. But these remnants of the\\nW**K worm were not dated 16 October or any time immediately around\\nthen. The logs showed worm-related activity up to two weeks before the\\nattack on NASA. This computer was not just a pass-through machine the\\nworm had used to launch its first attack on NASA. This was the\\ndevelopment machine.\\n\\nGround zero.\\n\\nTencati went into the meeting with DST at the FBI offices prepared. He\\nknew the accusations the French were going to put forward. When he\\npresented the results of his sleuthwork, the French secret service\\ncouldn\\'t refute it, but they dropped their own bombshell. Yes they\\ntold him, you might be able to point to a French system as ground zero\\nfor the attack, but our investigations reveal incoming X.25\\nconnections from elsewhere which coincided with the timing of the\\ndevelopment of the W**K worm.\\n\\nThe connections came from Australia.\\n\\nThe French had satisfied themselves that it wasn\\'t a French hacker who\\nhad created the W**K worm. Ce n\\'est pas notre problem. At least, it\\'s\\nnot our problem any more.\\n\\nIt is here that the trail begins to go cold. Law enforcement and\\ncomputer security people in the US and Australia had ideas about just\\nwho had created the W**K worm. Fingers were pointed, accusations were\\nmade, but none stuck. At the end of the day, there was coincidence and\\ninnuendo, but not enough evidence to launch a case. Like many\\nAustralian hackers, the creator of the W**K worm had emerged from the\\nshadows of the computer underground, stood momentarily in hazy\\nsilhouette, and then disappeared again.\\n\\n\\nThe Australian computer underground in the late 1980s was an\\nenvironment which spawned and shaped the author of the W**K worm.\\nAffordable home computers, such as the Apple IIe and the Commodore 64,\\nmade their way into ordinary suburban families. While these computers\\nwere not widespread, they were at least in a price range which made\\nthem attainable by dedicated computer enthusiasts.\\n\\nIn 1988, the year before the W**K worm attack on NASA, Australia was\\non an upswing. The country was celebrating its bicentennial. The\\neconomy was booming. Trade barriers and old regulatory structures were\\ncoming down. Crocodile Dundee had already burst on the world movie\\nscene and was making Australians the flavour of the month in cities\\nlike LA and New York. The mood was optimistic. People had a sense they\\nwere going places. Australia, a peaceful country of seventeen or so\\nmillion people, poised on the edge of Asia but with the order of a\\nWestern European democracy, was on its way up. Perhaps for the first\\ntime, Australians had lost their cultural cringe, a unique type of\\ninsecurity alien to can-do cultures such as that found in the US.\\nExploration and experimentation require confidence and, in 1988,\\nconfidence was something Australia had finally attained.\\n\\nYet this new-found confidence and optimism did not subdue Australia\\'s\\ntradition of cynicism toward large institutions. The two coexisted,\\nsuspended in a strange paradox. Australian humour, deeply rooted in a\\nscepticism of all things serious and sacred, continued to poke fun at\\nupright institutions with a depth of irreverence surprising to many\\nforeigners. This cynicism of large, respected institutions coursed\\nthrough the newly formed Australian computer underground without\\ndampening its excitement or optimism for the brave new world of\\ncomputers in the least.\\n\\nIn 1988, the Australian computer underground thrived like a vibrant\\nAsian street bazaar. In that year it was still a realm of place not\\nspace. Customers visited their regular stalls, haggled over goods with\\nvendors, bumped into friends and waved across crowded paths to\\nacquaintances. The market was as much a place to socialise as it was\\nto shop. People ducked into tiny coffee houses or corner bars for\\nintimate chats. The latest imported goods, laid out on tables like\\nreams of bright Chinese silks, served as conversation starters. And,\\nlike every street market, many of the best items were tucked away,\\nhidden in anticipation of the appearance of that one customer or\\nfriend most favoured by the trader. The currency of the underground\\nwas not money; it was information. People didn\\'t share and exchange\\ninformation to accumulate monetary wealth; they did it to win\\nrespect--and to buy a thrill.\\n\\nThe members of the Australian computer underground met on bulletin\\nboard systems, known as BBSes. Simple things by today\\'s standards,\\nBBSes were often composed of a souped-up Apple II computer, a single\\nmodem and a lone telephone line. But they drew people from all walks\\nof life. Teenagers from working-class neighbourhoods and those from\\nthe exclusive private schools. University students. People in their\\ntwenties groping their way through first jobs. Even some professional\\npeople in their thirties and forties who spent weekends poring over\\ncomputer manuals and building primitive computers in spare rooms. Most\\nregular BBS users were male. Sometimes a user\\'s sister would find her\\nway into the BBS world, often in search of a boyfriend. Mission\\naccomplished, she might disappear from the scene for weeks, perhaps\\nmonths, presumably until she required another visit.\\n\\nThe BBS users had a few things in common. They were generally of above\\naverage intelligence--usually with a strong technical slant--and they\\nwere obsessed with their chosen hobby. They had to be. It often took\\n45 minutes of attack dialling a busy BBS\\'s lone phone line just to\\nvisit the computer system for perhaps half an hour. Most serious BBS\\nhobbyists went through this routine several times each day.\\n\\nAs the name suggests, a BBS had what amounted to an electronic version\\nof a normal bulletin board. The owner of the BBS would have divided\\nthe board into different areas, as a school teacher crisscrosses\\ncoloured ribbon across the surface of a corkboard to divide it into\\nsections. A single BBS might have 30 or more electronic discussion\\ngroups.\\n\\nAs a user to the board, you might visit the politics section, tacking\\nup a `note\\' on your views of ALP or Liberal policies for anyone\\npassing by to read. Alternatively, you might fancy yourself a bit of a\\npoet and work up the courage to post an original piece of work in the\\nPoet\\'s Corner. The corner was often filled with dark, misanthropic\\nworks inspired by the miseries of adolescence. Perhaps you preferred\\nto discuss music. On many BBSes you could find postings on virtually\\nany type of music. The most popular groups included bands like Pink\\nFloyd, Tangerine Dream and Midnight Oil. Midnight Oil\\'s\\nanti-establishment message struck a particular chord within the new\\nBBS community.\\n\\nNineteen eighty-eight was the golden age of the BBS culture across\\nAustralia. It was an age of innocence and community, an open-air\\nbazaar full of vitality and the sharing of ideas. For the most part,\\npeople trusted their peers within the community and the BBS operators,\\nwho were often revered as demigods. It was a happy place. And, in\\ngeneral, it was a safe place, which is perhaps one reason why its\\nvisitors felt secure in their explorations of new ideas. It was a\\nplace in which the creator of the W**K worm could sculpt and hone his\\ncreative computer skills.\\n\\nThe capital of this spirited new Australian electronic civilisation\\nwas Melbourne. It is difficult to say why this southern city became\\nthe cultural centre of the BBS world, and its darker side, the\\nAustralian computer underground. Maybe the city\\'s history as\\nAustralia\\'s intellectual centre created a breeding ground for the many\\nyoung people who built their systems with little more than curiosity\\nand salvaged computer bits discarded by others. Maybe Melbourne\\'s\\npersonality as a city of suburban homebodies and backyard tinkerers\\nproduced a culture conducive to BBSes. Or maybe it was just\\nMelbourne\\'s dreary beaches and often miserable weather. As one\\nMelbourne hacker explained it, `What else is there to do here all\\nwinter but hibernate inside with your computer and modem?\\'\\n\\nIn 1988, Melbourne had some 60 to 100 operating BBSes. The numbers are\\nvague because it is difficult to count a collection of moving objects.\\nThe amateur nature of the systems, often a jumbled tangle of wires and\\nsecond-hand electronics parts soldered together in someone\\'s garage,\\nmeant that the life of any one system was frequently as short as a\\nteenager\\'s attention span. BBSes popped up, ran for two weeks, and\\nthen vanished again.\\n\\nSome of them operated only during certain hours, say between 10 p.m.\\nand 8 a.m. When the owner went to bed, he or she would plug the home\\nphone line into the BBS and leave it there until morning. Others ran\\n24 hours a day, but the busiest times were always at night.\\n\\nOf course it wasn\\'t just intellectual stimulation some users were\\nafter. Visitors often sought identity as much as ideas. On an\\nelectronic bulletin board, you could create a personality, mould it\\ninto shape and make it your own. Age and appearance did not matter.\\nTechnical aptitude did. Any spotty, gawky teenage boy could instantly\\ntransform himself into a suave, graceful BBS character. The\\ntransformation began with the choice of name. In real life, you might\\nbe stuck with the name Elliot Dingle--an appellation chosen by your\\nmother to honour a long-dead great uncle. But on a BBS, well, you\\ncould be Blade Runner, Ned Kelly or Mad Max. Small wonder that, given\\nthe choice, many teenage boys chose to spend their time in the world\\nof the BBS.\\n\\nGenerally, once a user chose a handle, as the on-line names are known,\\nhe stuck with it. All his electronic mail came to an account with that\\nname on it. Postings to bulletin boards were signed with it. Others\\ndwelling in the system world knew him by that name and no other. A\\nhandle evolved into a name laden with innate meaning, though the\\npersonality reflected in it might well have been an alter ego. And so\\nit was that characters like The Wizard, Conan and Iceman came to pass\\ntheir time on BBSes like the Crystal Palace, Megaworks, The Real\\nConnection and Electric Dreams.\\n\\nWhat such visitors valued about the BBS varied greatly. Some wanted to\\nparticipate in its social life. They wanted to meet people like\\nthemselves--bright but geeky or misanthropic people who shared an\\ninterest in the finer technical points of computers. Many lived as\\noutcasts in real life, never quite making it into the `normal\\' groups\\nof friends at school or uni. Though some had started their first jobs,\\nthey hadn\\'t managed to shake the daggy awkwardness which pursued them\\nthroughout their teen years. On the surface, they were just not the\\nsort of people one asked out to the pub for a cold one after the\\nfooty.\\n\\nBut that was all right. In general, they weren\\'t much interested in\\nfooty anyway.\\n\\nEach BBS had its own style. Some were completely legitimate, with\\ntheir wares--all legal goods--laid out in the open. Others, like The\\nReal Connection, had once housed Australia\\'s earliest hackers but had\\ngone straight. They closed up the hacking parts of the board before\\nthe first Commonwealth government hacking laws were enacted in June\\n1989. Perhaps ten or twelve of Melbourne\\'s BBSes at the time had the\\nsecret, smoky flavour of the computer underground. A handful of these\\nwere invitation-only boards, places like Greyhawk and The Realm. You\\ncouldn\\'t simply ring up the board, create a new account and login. You\\nhad to be invited by the board\\'s owner. Members of the general\\nmodeming public need not apply.\\n\\nThe two most important hubs in the Australian underground between 1987\\nand 1989 were named Pacific Island and Zen. A 23-year-old who called\\nhimself Craig Bowen ran both systems from his bedroom.\\n\\nAlso known as Thunderbird1, Bowen started up Pacific Island in 1987\\nbecause he wanted a hub for hackers. The fledgling hacking community\\nwas dispersed after AHUBBS, possibly Melbourne\\'s earliest hacking\\nboard, faded away. Bowen decided to create a home for it, a sort of\\ndark, womb-like cafe bar amid the bustle of the BBS bazaar where\\nMelbourne\\'s hackers could gather and share information.\\n\\nHis bedroom was a simple, boyish place. Built-in cupboards, a bed, a\\nwallpaper design of vintage cars running across one side of the room.\\nA window overlooking the neighbours\\' leafy suburban yard. A collection\\nof PC magazines with titles like Nibble and Byte. A few volumes on\\ncomputer programming. VAX/VMS manuals. Not many books, but a handful\\nof science fiction works by Arthur C. Clarke. The Hitchhiker\\'s Guide\\nto the Galaxy. A Chinese-language dictionary used during his high\\nschool Mandarin classes, and after, as he continued to study the\\nlanguage on his own while he held down his first job.\\n\\nThe Apple IIe, modem and telephone line rested on the drop-down\\ndrawing table and fold-up card table at the foot of his bed. Bowen put\\nhis TV next to the computer so he could sit in bed, watch TV and use\\nPacific Island all at the same time. Later, when he started Zen, it\\nsat next to Pacific Island. It was the perfect set-up.\\n\\nPacific Island was hardly fancy by today\\'s standards of Unix Internet\\nmachines, but in 1987 it was an impressive computer. PI, pronounced\\n`pie\\' by the local users, had a 20 megabyte hard drive--gargantuan for\\na personal computer at the time. Bowen spent about $5000 setting up PI\\nalone. He loved both systems and spent many hours each week nurturing\\nthem.\\n\\nThere was no charge for computer accounts on PI or ZEN, like most\\nBBSes. This gentle-faced youth, a half-boy, half-man who would\\neventually play host on his humble BBS to many of Australia\\'s\\ncleverest computer and telephone hackers, could afford to pay for his\\ncomputers for two reasons: he lived at home with his mum and dad, and\\nhe had a full-time job at Telecom--then the only domestic telephone\\ncarrier in Australia.\\n\\nPI had about 800 computer users, up to 200 of whom were `core\\' users\\naccessing the system regularly. PI had its own dedicated phone line,\\nseparate from the house phone so Bowen\\'s parents wouldn\\'t get upset the\\nline was always tied up. Later, he put in four additional phone lines\\nfor Zen, which had about 2000 users. Using his Telecom training, he\\ninstalled a number of non-standard, but legal, features to his\\nhouse. Junction boxes, master switches. Bowen\\'s house was a\\ntelecommunications hot-rod.\\n\\nBowen had decided early on that if he wanted to keep his job, he had\\nbetter not do anything illegal when it came to Telecom. However, the\\nAustralian national telecommunications carrier was a handy source of\\ntechnical information. For example, he had an account on a Telecom\\ncomputer system--for work--from which he could learn about Telecom\\'s\\nexchanges. But he never used that account for hacking. Most\\nrespectable hackers followed a similar philosophy. Some had legitimate\\nuniversity computer accounts for their courses, but they kept those\\naccounts clean. A basic rule of the underground, in the words of one\\nhacker, was `Don\\'t foul your own nest\\'.\\n\\nPI contained a public section and a private one. The public area was\\nlike an old-time pub. Anyone could wander in, plop down at the bar and\\nstart up a conversation with a group of locals. Just ring up the\\nsystem with your modem and type in your details--real name, your\\nchosen handle, phone number and other basic information.\\n\\nMany BBS users gave false information in order to hide their true\\nidentities, and many operators didn\\'t really care. Bowen, however,\\ndid. Running a hacker\\'s board carried some risk, even before the\\nfederal computer crime laws came into force. Pirated software was\\nillegal. Storing data copied from hacking adventures in foreign\\ncomputers might also be considered illegal. In an effort to exclude\\npolice and media spies, Bowen tried to verify the personal details of\\nevery user on PI by ringing them at home or work. Often he was\\nsuccessful. Sometimes he wasn\\'t.\\n\\nThe public section of PI housed discussion groups on the major PC\\nbrands--IBM, Commodore, Amiga, Apple and Atari--next to the popular\\nLonely Hearts group. Lonely Hearts had about twenty regulars, most of\\nwhom agonised under the weight of pubescent hormonal changes. A boy\\npining for the affections of the girl who dumped him or, worse, didn\\'t\\neven know he existed. Teenagers who contemplated suicide. The messages\\nwere completely anonymous, readers didn\\'t even know the authors\\'\\nhandles, and that anonymous setting allowed heart-felt messages and\\ngenuine responses.\\n\\nZen was PI\\'s sophisticated younger sister. Within two years of PI\\nmaking its debut, Bowen opened up Zen, one of the first Australian\\nBBSes with more than one telephone line. The main reason he set up Zen\\nwas to stop his computer users from bothering him all the time. When\\nsomeone logged into PI, one of the first things he or she did was\\nrequest an on-line chat with the system operator. PI\\'s Apple IIe was\\nsuch a basic machine by today\\'s standards, Bowen couldn\\'t multi-task\\non it. He could not do anything with the machine, such as check his\\nown mail, while a visitor was logged into PI.\\n\\nZen was a watershed in the Australian BBS community. Zen multi-tasked.\\nUp to four people could ring up and login to the machine at any one\\ntime, and Bowen could do his own thing while his users were on-line.\\nBetter still, his users could talk request each other instead of\\nhassling him all the time. Having users on a multi-tasking machine\\nwith multiple phone lines was like having a gaggle of children. For\\nthe most part, they amused each other.\\n\\nMainstream and respectful of authority on the surface, Bowen possessed\\nthe same streak of anti-establishment views harboured by many in the\\nunderground. His choice of name for Zen underlined this. Zen came from\\nthe futuristic British TV science fiction series `Blake 7\\', in which a\\nbunch of underfunded rebels attempted to overthrow an evil\\ntotalitarian government. Zen was the computer on the rebels\\' ship. The\\nrebels banded together after meeting on a prison ship; they were all\\nbeing transported to a penal settlement on another planet. It was a\\nstory people in the Australian underground could relate to. One of the\\nlead characters, a sort of heroic anti-hero, had been sentenced to\\nprison for computer hacking. His big mistake, he told fellow rebels,\\nwas that he had relied on other people. He trusted them. He should\\nhave worked alone.\\n\\nCraig Bowen had no idea of how true that sentiment would ring in a\\nmatter of months.\\n\\nBowen\\'s place was a hub of current and future lights in the computer\\nunderground. The Wizard. The Force. Powerspike. Phoenix. Electron.\\nNom. Prime Suspect. Mendax. Train Trax. Some, such as Prime Suspect,\\nmerely passed through, occasionally stopping in to check out the\\naction and greet friends. Others, such as Nom, were part of the\\nclose-knit PI family. Nom helped Bowen set up PI. Like many early\\nmembers of the underground, they met through AUSOM, an Apple users\\'\\nsociety in Melbourne. Bowen wanted to run ASCII Express, a program\\nwhich allowed people to transfer files between their own computers and\\nPI. But, as usual, he and everyone he knew only had a pirated copy of\\nthe program. No manuals. So Nom and Bowen spent one weekend picking\\napart the program by themselves. They were each at home, on their own\\nmachines, with copies. They sat on the phone for hours working through\\nhow the program worked. They wrote their own manual for other people\\nin the underground suffering under the same lack of documentation.\\nThen they got it up and running on PI.\\n\\nMaking your way into the various groups in a BBS such as PI or Zen had\\nbenefits besides hacking information. If you wanted to drop your\\nmantle of anonymity, you could join a pre-packaged, close-knit circle\\nof friends. For example, one clique of PI people were fanatical\\nfollowers of the film The Blues Brothers. Every Friday night, this\\ngroup dressed up in Blues Brothers costumes of a dark suit, white\\nshirt, narrow tie, Rayban sunglasses and, of course, the snap-brimmed\\nhat. One couple brought their child, dressed as a mini-Blues Brother.\\nThe group of Friday night regulars made their way at 11.30 to\\nNorthcote\\'s Valhalla Theatre (now the Westgarth). Its grand but\\nslightly tatty vintage atmosphere lent itself to this alternative\\nculture flourishing in late-night revelries. Leaping up on stage\\nmid-film, the PI groupies sent up the actors in key scenes. It was a\\nfun and, as importantly, a cheap evening. The Valhalla staff admitted\\nregulars who were dressed in appropriate costume for free. The only\\nthing the groupies had to pay for was drinks at the intermission.\\n\\nOccasionally, Bowen arranged gatherings of other young PI and Zen\\nusers. Usually, the group met in downtown Melbourne, sometimes at the\\nCity Square. The group was mostly boys, but sometimes a few girls\\nwould show up. Bowen\\'s sister, who used the handle Syn, hung around a\\nbit. She went out with a few hackers from the BBS scene. And she\\nwasn\\'t the only one. It was a tight group which interchanged\\nboyfriends and girlfriends with considerable regularity. The group\\nhung out in the City Square after watching a movie, usually a horror\\nfilm. Nightmare 2. House 3. Titles tended to be a noun followed by a\\nnumeral. Once, for a bit of lively variation, they went bowling and\\ndrove the other people at the alley nuts. After the early\\nentertainment, it was down to McDonald\\'s for a cheap burger. They\\njoked and laughed and threw gherkins against the restaurant\\'s wall.\\nThis was followed by more hanging around on the stone steps of the\\nCity Square before catching the last bus or train home.\\n\\nThe social sections of PI and Zen were more successful than the\\ntechnical ones, but the private hacking section was even more\\nsuccessful than the others. The hacking section was hidden; would-be\\nmembers of the Melbourne underground knew there was something going\\non, but they couldn\\'t find out what is was.\\n\\nGetting an invite to the private area required hacking skill or\\ninformation, and usually a recommendation to Bowen from someone who\\nwas already inside. Within the Inner Sanctum, as the private hacking\\narea was called, people could comfortably share information such as\\nopinions of new computer products, techniques for hacking, details of\\ncompanies which had set up new sites to hack and the latest rumours on\\nwhat the law enforcement agencies were up to.\\n\\nThe Inner Sanctum was not, however, the only private room. Two hacking\\ngroups, Elite and H.A.C.K., guarded entry to their yet more exclusive\\nback rooms. Even if you managed to get entry to the Inner Sanctum, you\\nmight not even know that H.A.C.K. or Elite existed. You might know\\nthere was a place even more selective than your area, but exactly how\\nmany layers of the onion stood between you and the most exclusive\\nsection was anyone\\'s guess. Almost every hacker interviewed for this\\nbook described a vague sense of being somehow outside the innermost\\ncircle. They knew it was there, but wasn\\'t sure just what it was.\\n\\nBowen fielded occasional phone calls on his voice line from wanna-be\\nhackers trying to pry open the door to the Inner Sanctum. `I want\\naccess to your pirate system,\\' the voice would whine.\\n\\n`What pirate system? Who told you my system was a pirate system?\\'\\n\\nBowen sussed out how much the caller knew, and who had told him. Then\\nhe denied everything.\\n\\nTo avoid these requests, Bowen had tried to hide his address, real\\nname and phone number from most of the people who used his BBSes. But\\nhe wasn\\'t completely successful. He had been surprised by the sudden\\nappearance one day of Masked Avenger on his doorstep. How Masked\\nAvenger actually found his address was a mystery. The two had chatted\\nin a friendly fashion on-line, but Bowen didn\\'t give out his details.\\nNothing could have prepared him for the little kid in the big crash\\nhelmet standing by his bike in front of Bowen\\'s house. `Hi!\\' he\\nsqueaked. `I\\'m the Masked Avenger!\\'\\n\\nMasked Avenger--a boy perhaps fifteen years old--was quite resourceful\\nto have found out Bowen\\'s details. Bowen invited him in and showed him\\nthe system. They became friends. But after that incident, Bowen\\ndecided to tighten security around his personal details even more. He\\nbegan, in his own words, `moving toward full anonymity\\'. He invented\\nthe name Craig Bowen, and everyone in the underground came to know him\\nby that name or his handle, Thunderbird1. He even opened a false bank\\naccount in the name of Bowen for the periodic voluntary donations\\nusers sent into PI. It was never a lot of money, mostly $5 or $10,\\nbecause students don\\'t tend to have much money. He ploughed it all\\nback into PI.\\n\\nPeople had lots of reasons for wanting to get into the Inner Sanctum.\\nSome wanted free copies of the latest software, usually pirated games\\nfrom the US. Others wanted to share information and ideas about ways\\nto break into computers, often those owned by local universities.\\nStill others wanted to learn about how to manipulate the telephone\\nsystem.\\n\\nThe private areas functioned like a royal court, populated by\\naristocrats and courtiers with varying seniority, loyalties and\\nrivalries. The areas involved an intricate social order and respect\\nwas the name of the game. If you wanted admission, you had to walk a\\ndelicate line between showing your superiors that you possessed enough\\nvaluable hacking information to be elite and not showing them so much\\nthey would brand you a blabbermouth. A perfect bargaining chip was an\\nold password for Melbourne University\\'s dial-out.\\n\\nThe university\\'s dial-out was a valuable thing. A hacker could ring up\\nthe university\\'s computer, login as `modem\\' and the machine would drop\\nhim into a modem which let him dial out again. He could then dial\\nanywhere in the world, and the university would foot the phone bill.\\nIn the late 1980s, before the days of cheap, accessible Internet\\nconnections, the university dial-out meant a hacker could access\\nanything from an underground BBS in Germany to a US military system in\\nPanama. The password put the world at his fingertips.\\n\\nA hacker aspiring to move into PI\\'s Inner Sanctum wouldn\\'t give out\\nthe current dial-out password in the public discussion areas. Most\\nlikely, if he was low in the pecking order, he wouldn\\'t have such\\nprecious information. Even if he had managed to stumble across the\\ncurrent password somehow, it was risky giving it out publicly. Every\\nwanna-be and his dog would start messing around with the university\\'s\\nmodem account. The system administrator would wise up and change the\\npassword and the hacker would quickly lose his own access to the\\nuniversity account. Worse, he would lose access for other hackers--the\\nkind of hackers who ran H.A.C.K., Elite and the Inner Sanctum. They\\nwould be really cross. Hackers hate it when passwords on accounts they\\nconsider their own are changed without warning. Even if the password\\nwasn\\'t changed, the aspiring hacker would look like a guy who couldn\\'t\\nkeep a good secret.\\n\\nPosting an old password, however, was quite a different matter. The\\ninformation was next to useless, so the hacker wouldn\\'t be giving much\\naway. But just showing he had access to that sort of information\\nsuggested he was somehow in the know. Other hackers might think he had\\nhad the password when it was still valid. More importantly, by showing\\noff a known, expired password, the hacker hinted that he might just\\nhave the current password. Voila! Instant respect.\\n\\nPositioning oneself to win an invite into the Inner Sanctum was a game\\nof strategy; titillate but never go all the way. After a while,\\nsomeone on the inside would probably notice you and put in a word with\\nBowen. Then you would get an invitation.\\n\\nIf you were seriously ambitious and wanted to get past the first inner\\nlayer, you then had to start performing for real. You couldn\\'t hide\\nbehind the excuse that the public area might be monitored by the\\nauthorities or was full of idiots who might abuse valuable hacking\\ninformation.\\n\\nThe hackers in the most elite area would judge you on how much\\ninformation you provided about breaking into computer or phone\\nsystems. They also looked at the accuracy of the information. It was\\neasy getting out-of-date login names and passwords for a student\\naccount on Monash University\\'s computer system. Posting a valid\\naccount for the New Zealand forestry department\\'s VMS system intrigued\\nthe people who counted considerably more.\\n\\nThe Great Rite of Passage from boy to man in the computer underground\\nwas Minerva. OTC, Australia\\'s then government-owned Overseas\\nTelecommunications Commission,3 ran Minerva, a system of three Prime\\nmainframes in Sydney. For hackers such as Mendax, breaking into\\nMinerva was the test.\\n\\nBack in early 1988, Mendax was just beginning to explore the world of\\nhacking. He had managed to break through the barrier from public to\\nprivate section of PI, but it wasn\\'t enough. To be recognised as\\nup-and-coming talent by the aristocracy of hackers such as The Force\\nand The Wizard, a hacker had to spend time inside the Minerva system.\\nMendax set to work on breaking\\ninto it.\\n\\nMinerva was special for a number of reasons. Although it was in\\nSydney, the phone number to its entry computer, called an X.25 pad,\\nwas a free call. At the time Mendax lived in Emerald, a country town\\non the outskirts of Melbourne. A call to most Melbourne numbers\\nincurred a long-distance charge, thus ruling out options such as the\\nMelbourne University dial-out for breaking into international computer\\nsystems.\\n\\nEmerald was hardly Emerald City. For a clever sixteen-year-old boy,\\nthe place was dead boring. Mendax lived there with his mother; Emerald\\nwas merely a stopping point, one of dozens, as his mother shuttled her\\nchild around the continent trying to escape from a psychopathic former\\nde facto. The house was an emergency refuge for families on the run.\\nIt was safe and so, for a time, Mendax and his exhausted family\\nstopped to rest before tearing off again in search of a new place to\\nhide.\\n\\nSometimes Mendax went to school. Often he didn\\'t. The school system\\ndidn\\'t hold much interest for him. It didn\\'t feed his mind the way\\nMinerva would. They Sydney computer system was a far more interesting\\nplace to muck around in than the rural high school.\\n\\nMinerva was a Prime computer, and Primes were in. Force, one of the\\nmore respected hackers in 1987-88 in the Australian computer\\nunderground, specialised in Primos, the special operating system used\\non Prime computers. He wrote his own programs--potent hacking tools\\nwhich provided current usernames and passwords--and made the systems\\nfashionable in the computer underground.\\n\\nPrime computers were big and expensive and no hacker could afford one,\\nso being able to access the speed and computational grunt of a system\\nlike Minerva was valuable for running a hacker\\'s own programs. For\\nexample, a network scanner, a program which gathered the addresses of\\ncomputers on the X.25 network which would be targets for future\\nhacking adventures, ate up computing resources. But a huge machine\\nlike Minerva could handle that sort of program with ease. Minerva also\\nallowed users to connect to other computer systems on the X.25 network\\naround the world. Better still, Minerva had a BASIC interpreter on it.\\nThis allowed people to write programs in the BASIC programming\\nlanguage--by far the most popular language at the time--and make them\\nrun on Minerva. You didn\\'t have to be a Primos fanatic, like Force, to\\nwrite and execute a program on the OTC computer. Minerva suited Mendax\\nvery well.\\n\\nThe OTC system had other benefits. Most major Australian corporations\\nhad accounts on the system. Breaking into an account requires a\\nusername and password; find the username and you have solved half the\\nequation. Minerva account names were easy picking. Each one was\\ncomposed of three letters followed by three numbers, a system which\\ncould have been difficult to crack except for the choice of those\\nletters and numbers. The first three letters were almost always\\nobvious acronyms for the company. For example, the ANZ Bank had\\naccounts named ANZ001, ANZ002 and ANZ002. The numbers followed the\\nsame pattern for most companies. BHP001. CRA001. NAB001. Even OTC007.\\nAnyone with the IQ of a desk lamp could guess at least a few account\\nnames on Minerva. Passwords were a bit tougher to come by, but Mendax\\nhad some ideas for that. He was going to have a crack at social\\nengineering. Social engineering means smooth-talking someone in a\\nposition of power into doing something for you. It always involved a\\nruse of some sort.\\n\\nMendax decided he would social engineer a password out of one of\\nMinerva\\'s users. He had downloaded a partial list of Minerva users\\nanother PI hacker had generously posted for those talented enough to\\nmake use of it. This list was maybe two years old, and incomplete, but\\nit contained 30-odd pages of Minerva account usernames, company names,\\naddresses, contact names and telephone and fax numbers. Some of them\\nwould probably still be valid.\\n\\nMendax had a deep voice for his age; it would have been impossible to\\neven contemplate social engineering without it. Cracking adolescent\\nmale voices were the kiss of death for would-be social engineers. But\\neven though he had the voice, he didn\\'t have the office or the Sydney\\nphone number if the intended victim wanted a number to call back on.\\nHe found a way to solve the Sydney phone number by poking around until\\nhe dug up a number with Sydney\\'s 02 area code which was permanently\\nengaged. One down, one to go.\\n\\nNext problem: generate some realistic office background noise. He\\ncould hardly call a company posing as an OTC official to cajole a\\npassword when the only background noise was birds tweeting in the\\nfresh country air.\\n\\nNo, he needed the same background buzz as a crowded office in downtown\\nSydney. Mendex had a tape recorder, so he could pre-record the sound\\nof an office and play it as background when he called companies on the\\nMinerva list. The only hurdle was finding the appropriate office\\nnoise. Not even the local post office would offer a believable noise\\nlevel. With none easily accessible, he decided to make his own audible\\noffice clutter. It wouldn\\'t be easy. With a single track on his\\nrecording device, he couldn\\'t dub in sounds on top of each other: he\\nhad to make all the noises simultaneously.\\n\\nFirst, he turned on the TV news, down very low, so it just hummed in\\nthe background. Then he set up a long document to print on his\\nCommodore MPS 801 printer. He removed the cover from the noisy dot\\nmatrix machine, to create just the right volume of clackity-clack in\\nthe background. Still, he needed something more. Operators\\' voices\\nmumbling across a crowded floor. He could mumble quietly to himself,\\nbut he soon discovered his verbal skills had not developed to the\\npoint of being able to stand in the middle of the room talking about\\nnothing to himself for a quarter of an hour. So he fished out his\\nvolume of Shakespeare and started reading aloud. Loud enough to hear\\nvoices, but not so loud that the intended victim would be able to pick\\nMacbeth. OTC operators had keyboards, so he began tapping randomly on\\nhis. Occasionally, for a little variation, he walked up to the tape\\nrecorder and asked a question--and then promptly answered it in\\nanother voice. He stomped noisily away from the recorder again, across\\nthe room, and then silently dove back to the keyboard for more\\nkeyboard typing and mumblings of Macbeth.\\n\\nIt was exhausting. He figured the tape had to run for at least fifteen\\nminutes uninterrupted. It wouldn\\'t look very realistic if the office\\nbuzz suddenly went dead for three seconds at a time in the places\\nwhere he paused the tape to rest.\\n\\nThe tapes took a number of attempts. He would be halfway through,\\nracing through line after line of Shakespeare, rap-tap-tapping on his\\nkeyboard and asking himself questions in authoritative voices when the\\npaper jammed in his printer. Damn. He had to start all over again.\\nFinally, after a tiring hour of auditory schizophrenia, he had the\\nperfect tape of office hubbub.\\n\\nMendax pulled out his partial list of Minerva users and began working\\nthrough the 30-odd pages. It was discouraging.\\n\\n`The number you have dialled is not connected. Please check the number\\nbefore dialling again.\\'\\n\\nNext number.\\n\\n`Sorry, he is in a meeting at the moment. Can I have him return your\\ncall?\\' Ah, no thanks.\\n\\nAnother try.\\n\\n`That person is no longer working with our company. Can I refer you to\\nsomeone else?\\' Uhm, not really.\\n\\nAnd another try.\\n\\nFinally, success.\\n\\nMendax reached one of the contact names for a company in Perth. Valid\\nnumber, valid company, valid contact name. He cleared his throat to\\ndeepen his voice even further and began.\\n\\n`This is John Keller, an operator from OTC Minerva in Sydney. One of\\nour D090 hard drives has crashed. We\\'ve pulled across the data on the\\nback-up tape and we believe we have all your correct information. But\\nsome of it might have been corrupted in the accident and we would just\\nlike to confirm your details. Also the back-up tape is two days old,\\nso we want to check your information is up to date so your service is\\nnot interrupted. Let me just dig out your details ...\\' Mendax shuffled\\nsome papers around on the table top.\\n\\n`Oh, dear. Yes. Let\\'s check it,\\' the worried manager responded.\\n\\nMendax started reading all the information on the Minerva list\\nobtained from Pacific Island, except for one thing. He changed the fax\\nnumber slightly. It worked. The manager jumped right in.\\n\\n`Oh, no. That\\'s wrong. Our fax number is definitely wrong,\\' he said\\nand proceeded to give the correct number.\\n\\nMendax tried to sound concerned. `Hmm,\\' he told the manager. `We may\\nhave bigger problems than we anticipated. Hmm.\\' He gave another\\npregnant pause. Working up the courage to ask the Big Question.\\n\\nIt was hard to know who was sweating more, the fretting Perth manager,\\ntormented by the idea of loud staff complaints from all over the\\ncompany because the Minerva account was faulty, or the gangly kid\\ntrying his hand at social engineering for the first time.\\n\\n`Well,\\' Mendax began, trying to keep the sound of authority in his\\nvoice. `Let\\'s see. We have your account number, but we had better\\ncheck your password ... what was it?\\' An arrow shot from the bow.\\n\\nIt hit the target. `Yes, it\\'s L-U-R-C-H--full stop.\\'\\n\\nLurch? Uhuh. An Addams Family fan.\\n\\n`Can you make sure everything is working? We don\\'t want our service\\ninterrupted.\\' The Perth manager sounded quite anxious.\\n\\nMendax tapped away on the keyboard randomly and then paused. `Well, it\\nlooks like everything is working just fine now,\\' he quickly reassured\\nhim. Just fine.\\n\\n`Oh, that\\'s a relief!\\' the Perth manager exclaimed. `Thank you for\\nthat. Thank you. I just can\\'t thank you enough for calling us!\\' More\\ngratitude.\\n\\nMendax had to extract himself. This was getting embarrassing.\\n\\n`Yes, well I\\'d better go now. More customers to call.\\' That should\\nwork. The Perth manager wanted a contact telephone number, as\\nexpected, if something went wrong--so Mendax gave him the one which\\nwas permanently busy.\\n\\n`Thank you again for your courteous service!\\' Uhuh. Anytime.\\n\\nMendax hung up and tried the toll-free Minerva number. The password\\nworked. He couldn\\'t believe how easy it was to get in.\\n\\nHe had a quick look around, following the pattern of most hackers\\nbreaking into a new machine. First thing to do was to check the\\nelectronic mail of the `borrowed\\' account. Email often contains\\nvaluable information. One company manager might send another\\ninformation about other account names, password changes or even phone\\nnumbers to modems at the company itself. Then it was off to check the\\ndirectories available for anyone to read on the main system--another\\ngood source of information. Final stop: Minerva\\'s bulletin board of\\nnews. This included postings from the system operators about planned\\ndowntime or other service issues. He didn\\'t stay long. The first visit\\nwas usually mostly a bit of reconnaissance work.\\n\\nMinerva had many uses. Most important among these was the fact that\\nMinerva gave hackers an entry point into various X.25 networks. X.25\\nis a type of computer communications network, much like the Unix-based\\nInternet or the VMS-based DECNET. It has different commands and\\nprotocols, but the principle of an extensive worldwide data\\ncommunications network is the same. There is, however, one important\\ndifference. The targets for hackers on the X.25 networks are often far\\nmore interesting. For example, most banks are on X.25. Indeed, X.25\\nunderpins many aspects of the world\\'s financial markets. A number of\\ncountries\\' classified military computer sites only run on X.25. It is\\nconsidered by many people to be more secure than the Internet or any\\nDECNET system.\\n\\nMinerva allowed incoming callers to pass into the X.25\\nnetwork--something most Australian universities did not offer at the\\ntime. And Minerva let Australian callers do this without incurring a\\nlong-distance telephone charge.\\n\\nIn the early days of Minerva, the OTC operators didn\\'t seem to care\\nmuch about the hackers, probably because it seemed impossible to get\\nrid of them. The OTC operators managed the OTC X.25 exchange, which\\nwas like a telephone exchange for the X.25 data network. This exchange\\nwas the data gateway for Minerva and other systems connected to that\\ndata network.\\n\\nAustralia\\'s early hackers had it easy, until Michael Rosenberg\\narrived.\\n\\nRosenberg, known on-line simply as MichaelR, decided to clean up\\nMinerva. An engineering graduate from Queensland University, Michael\\nmoved to Sydney when he joined OTC at age 21. He was about the same\\nage as the hackers he was chasing off his system. Rosenberg didn\\'t\\nwork as an OTC operator, he managed the software which ran on Minerva.\\nAnd he made life hell for people like Force. Closing up security\\nholes, quietly noting accounts used by hackers and then killing those\\naccounts, Rosenberg almost single-handedly stamped out much of the\\nhacker activity in OTC\\'s Minerva.\\n\\nDespite this, the hackers--`my hackers\\' as he termed the regulars--had\\na grudging respect for Rosenberg. Unlike anyone else at OTC, he was\\ntheir technical equal and, in a world where technical prowess was the\\ncurrency, Rosenberg was a wealthy young man.\\n\\nHe wanted to catch the hackers, but he didn\\'t want to see them go to\\nprison. They were an annoyance, and he just wanted them out of his\\nsystem. Any line trace, however, had to go through Telecom, which was\\nat that time a separate body from OTC. Telecom, Rosenberg was told,\\nwas difficult about these things because of strict privacy laws. So,\\nfor the most part, he was left to deal with the hackers on his own.\\nRosenberg could not secure his system completely since OTC didn\\'t\\ndictate passwords to their customers. Their customers were usually\\nmore concerned about employees being able to remember passwords easily\\nthan worrying about warding off wily hackers. The result: the\\npasswords on a number of Minerva accounts were easy pickings.\\n\\nThe hackers and OTC waged a war from 1988 to 1990, and it was fought\\nin many ways.\\n\\nSometimes an OTC operator would break into a hacker\\'s on-line session\\ndemanding to know who was really using the account. Sometimes the\\noperators sent insulting messages to the hackers--and the hackers gave\\nit right back to them. They broke into the hacker\\'s session with `Oh,\\nyou idiots are at it again\\'. The operators couldn\\'t keep the hackers\\nout, but they had other ways of getting even.\\n\\nElectron, a Melbourne hacker and rising star in the Australian\\nunderground, had been logging into a system in Germany via OTC\\'s X.25\\nlink. Using a VMS machine, a sort of sister system to Minerva, he had\\nbeen playing a game called Empire on the Altos system, a popular\\nhang-out for hackers. It was his first attempt at Empire, a complex\\nwar game of strategy which attracted players from around the world.\\nThey each had less than one hour per day to conquer regions while\\nkeeping production units at a strategic level. The Melbourne hacker\\nhad spent weeks building his position. He was in second place.\\n\\nThen, one day, he logged into the game via Minerva and the German\\nsystem, and he couldn\\'t believe what he saw on the screen in front of\\nhim. His regions, his position in the game, all of it--weeks of\\nwork--had been wiped out. An OTC operator had used an X.25\\npacket-sniffer to monitor the hacker\\'s login and capture his password to\\nEmpire. Instead of trading the usual insults, the operator had waited\\nfor the hacker to logoff and then had hacked into the game and destroyed\\nthe hacker\\'s position.\\n\\nElectron was furious. He had been so proud of his position in his very\\nfirst game. Still, wreaking havoc on the Minerva system in retribution\\nwas out of the question. Despite the fact that they wasted weeks of\\nhis work, Electron had no desire to damage their system. He considered\\nhimself lucky to be able to use it as long as he did.\\n\\nThe anti-establishment attitudes nurtured in BBSes such as PI and Zen\\nfed on a love of the new and untried. There was no bitterness, just a\\ndesire to throw off the mantle of the old and dive into the new.\\nCamaraderie grew from the exhilarating sense that the youth in this\\nparticular time and place were constantly on the edge of big\\ndiscoveries. People were calling up computers with their modems and\\nexperimenting. What did this key sequence do? What about that tone?\\nWhat would happen if ... It was the question which drove them to stay\\nup day and night, poking and prodding. These hackers didn\\'t for the\\nmost part do drugs. They didn\\'t even drink that much, given their age.\\nAll of that would have interfered with their burning desire to know,\\nwould have dulled their sharp edge. The underground\\'s\\nanti-establishment views were mostly directed at organisations which\\nseemed to block the way to the new frontier--organisations like\\nTelecom.\\n\\nIt was a powerful word. Say `Telecom\\' to a member of the computer\\nunderground from that era and you will observe the most striking\\nreaction. Instant contempt sweeps across his face. There is a pause as\\nhis lips curl into a noticeable sneer and he replies with complete\\nderision, `Telescum\\'. The underground hated Australia\\'s national\\ntelephone carrier with a passion equalled only to its love of\\nexploration. They felt that Telecom was backward and its staff had no\\nidea how to use their own telecommunications technology. Worst of all,\\nTelecom seemed to actively dislike BBSes.\\n\\nLine noise interfered with one modem talking to another, and in the\\neyes of the computer underground, Telecom was responsible for the line\\nnoise. A hacker might be reading a message on PI, and there, in the\\nmiddle of some juicy technical titbit, would be a bit of crud--random\\ncharacters `2\\'28 v\\'1\\';D>nj4\\'--followed by the comment, `Line noise.\\nDamn Telescum! At their best as usual, I see\\'. Sometimes the line\\nnoise was so bad it logged the hacker off, thus forcing him to spend\\nanother 45 minutes attack dialling the BBS. The modems didn\\'t have\\nerror correction, and the faster the modem speed, the worse the impact\\nof line noise. Often it became a race to read mail and post messages\\nbefore Telecom\\'s line noise logged the hacker off.\\n\\nRumours flew through the underground again and again that Telecom was\\ntrying to bring in timed local calls. The volume of outrage was\\ndeafening. The BBS community believed it really irked the national\\ncarrier that people could spend an hour logged into a BBS for the cost\\nof one local phone call. Even more heinous, other rumours abounded\\nthat Telecom had forced at least one BBS to limit each incoming call\\nto under half an hour. Hence Telecom\\'s other nickname in the computer\\nunderground: Teleprofit.\\n\\nTo the BBS community, Telecom\\'s Protective Services Unit was the\\nenemy. They were the electronic police. The underground saw Protective\\nServices as `the enforcers\\'--an all-powerful government force which\\ncould raid your house, tap your phone line and seize your computer\\nequipment at any time. The ultimate reason to hate Telecom.\\n\\nThere was such hatred of Telecom that people in the computer\\nunderground routinely discussed ways of sabotaging the carrier. Some\\npeople talked of sending 240 volts of electricity down the telephone\\nline--an act which would blow up bits of the telephone exchange along\\nwith any line technicians who happened to be working on the cable at\\nthe time. Telecom had protective fuses which stopped electrical surges\\non the line, but BBS hackers had reportedly developed circuit plans\\nwhich would allow high-frequency voltages to bypass them. Other\\nmembers of the underground considered what sweet justice it would be\\nto set fire to all the cables outside a particular Telecom exchange\\nwhich had an easily accessible cable entrance duct.\\n\\nIt was against this backdrop that the underground began to shift into\\nphreaking. Phreaking is loosely defined as hacking the telephone\\nsystem. It is a very loose definition. Some people believe phreaking\\nincludes stealing a credit card number and using it to make a\\nlong-distance call for free. Purists shun this definition. To them,\\nusing a stolen credit card is not phreaking, it is carding. They argue\\nthat phreaking demands a reasonable level of technical skill and\\ninvolves manipulation of a telephone exchange. This manipulation may\\nmanifest itself as using computers or electrical circuits to generate\\nspecial tones or modify the voltage of a phone line. The manipulation\\nchanges how the telephone exchange views a particular telephone\\nline. The result: a free and hopefully untraceable call. The purist\\nhacker sees phreaking more as a way of eluding telephone traces than of\\ncalling his or her friends around the world for free.\\n\\nThe first transition into phreaking and eventually carding happened\\nover a period of about six months in 1988. Early hackers on PI and Zen\\nrelied primarily on dial-outs, like those at Melbourne University or\\nTelecom\\'s Clayton office, to bounce around international computer\\nsites. They also used X.25 dial-outs in other countries--the US,\\nSweden and Germany--to make another leap in their international\\njourneys.\\n\\nGradually, the people running these dial-out lines wised up. Dial-outs\\nstarted drying up. Passwords were changed. Facilities were cancelled.\\nBut the hackers didn\\'t want to give up access to overseas systems.\\nThey\\'d had their first taste of international calling and they wanted\\nmore. There was a big shiny electronic world to explore out there.\\nThey began trying different methods of getting where they wanted to\\ngo. And so the Melbourne underground moved into phreaking.\\n\\nPhreakers swarmed to PABXes like bees to honey. A PABX, a private\\nautomatic branch exchange, works like a mini-Telecom telephone\\nexchange. Using a PABX, the employee of a large company could dial\\nanother employee in-house without incurring the cost of a local\\ntelephone call. If the employee was, for example, staying in a hotel\\nout of town, the company might ask him to make all his calls through\\nthe company\\'s PABX to avoid paying extortionate hotel long-distance\\nrates. If the employee was in Brisbane on business, he could dial a\\nBrisbane number which might route him via the company\\'s PABX to\\nSydney. From there, he might dial out to Rome or London, and the\\ncharge would be billed directly to the company. What worked for an\\nemployee also worked for a phreaker.\\n\\nA phreaker dialling into the PABX would generally need to either know\\nor guess the password allowing him to dial out again. Often, the\\nphreaker was greeted by an automated message asking for the employee\\'s\\ntelephone extension--which also served as the password. Well, that was\\neasy enough. The phreaker simply tried a series of numbers until he\\nfound one which actually worked.\\n\\nOccasionally, a PABX system didn\\'t even have passwords. The managers\\nof the PABX figured that keeping the phone number secret was good\\nenough security. Sometimes phreakers made free calls out of PABXes\\nsimply by exploited security flaws in a particular model or brand of\\nPABX. A series of specific key presses allowed the phreaker to get in\\nwithout knowing a password, an employee\\'s name, or even the name of\\nthe company for that matter.\\n\\nAs a fashionable pastime on BBSes, phreaking began to surpass hacking.\\nPI established a private phreaking section. For a while, it became\\nalmost old hat to call yourself a hacker. Phreaking was forging the\\npath forward.\\n\\nSomewhere in this transition, the Phreakers Five sprung to life. A\\ngroup of five hackers-turned-phreakers gathered in an exclusive group\\non PI. Tales of their late-night podding adventures leaked into the\\nother areas of the BBS and made would-be phreakers green with\\njealousy.\\n\\nFirst, the phreakers would scout out a telephone pod--the grey steel,\\nrounded box perched nondescriptly on most streets. Ideally, the chosen\\npod would be by a park or some other public area likely to be deserted\\nat night. Pods directly in front of suburban houses were a bit\\nrisky--the house might contain a nosy little old lady with a penchant\\nfor calling the local police if anything looked suspicious. And what\\nshe would see, if she peered out from behind her lace curtains, was a\\nsmall tornado of action.\\n\\nOne of the five would leap from the van and open the pod with a key\\nbegged, borrowed or stolen from a Telecom technician. The keys seemed\\neasy enough to obtain. The BBSes message boards were rife with gleeful\\ntales of valuable Telecom equipment, such as 500 metres of cable or a\\npod key, procured off a visiting Telecom repairman either through\\nlegitimate means or in exchange for a six-pack of beer.\\n\\nThe designated phreaker would poke inside the pod until he found\\nsomeone else\\'s phone line. He\\'d strip back the cable, whack on a pair\\nof alligator clips and, if he wanted to make a voice call, run it to a\\nlinesman\\'s handset also borrowed, bought or stolen from Telecom. If he\\nwanted to call another computer instead of talking voice, he would\\nneed to extend the phone line back to the phreakers\\' car. This is\\nwhere the 500 metres of Telecom cable came in handy. A long cable\\nmeant the car, containing five anxious, whispering young men and a\\nveritable junkyard of equipment, would not have to sit next to the pod\\nfor hours on end. That sort of scene might look a little suspicious to\\na local resident out walking his or her dog late one night.\\n\\nThe phreaker ran the cable down the street and, if possible, around\\nthe corner. He pulled it into the car and attached it to the waiting\\ncomputer modem. At least one of the five was proficient enough with\\nelectronics hardware to have rigged up the computer and modem to the\\ncar battery. The Phreaker\\'s Five could now call any computer without\\nbeing traced or billed. The phone call charges would appear at the end\\nof a local resident\\'s phone bill. Telecom did not itemise residential\\ntelephone bills at the time. True, it was a major drama to zoom around\\nsuburban streets in the middle of the night with computers, alligator\\nclips and battery adaptors in tow, but that didn\\'t matter so much. In\\nfact, the thrill of such a cloak-and-dagger operation was as good as\\nthe actual hacking itself. It was illicit. In the phreakers\\' own eyes,\\nit was clever. And therefore it was fun.\\n\\nCraig Bowen didn\\'t think much of the Phreakers Five\\'s style of\\nphreaking. In fact, the whole growth of phreaking as a pastime\\ndepressed him a bit. He believed it just didn\\'t require the technical\\nskills of proper hacking. Hacking was, in his view, about the\\nexploration of a brave new world of computers. Phreaking was, well, a\\nbit beneath a good hacker. Somehow it demeaned the task at hand.\\n\\nStill, he could see how in some cases it was necessary in order to\\ncontinue hacking. Most people in the underground developed some basic\\nskills in phreaking, though people like Bowen always viewed it more as\\na means to an end--just a way of getting from computer A to computer\\nB, nothing more. Nonetheless, he allowed phreaking discussion areas in\\nthe private sections of PI.\\n\\nWhat he refused to allow was discussion areas around credit card\\nfraud. Carding was anathema to Bowen and he watched with alarm as some\\nmembers of the underground began to shift from phreaking into carding.\\n\\nLike the transition into phreaking, the move into carding was a\\nlogical progression. It occurred over a period of perhaps six months\\nin 1988 and was as obvious as a group of giggling schoolgirls.\\n\\nMany phreakers saw it simply as another type of phreaking. In fact it\\nwas a lot less hassle than manipulating some company\\'s PABX. Instead,\\nyou just call up an operator, give him some stranger\\'s credit card\\nnumber to pay for the call, and you were on your way. Of course, the\\ncredit cards had a broader range of uses than the PABXes. The advent\\nof carding meant you could telephone your friends in the US or UK and\\nhave a long voice conference call with all of them\\nsimultaneously--something which could be a lot tougher to arrange on a\\nPABX. There were other benefits. You could actually charge things with\\nthat credit card. As in goods. Mail order goods.\\n\\nOne member of the underground who used the handle Ivan Trotsky,\\nallegedly ordered $50000 worth of goods, including a jet ski, from the\\nUS on a stolen card, only to leave it sitting on the Australian docks.\\nThe Customs guys don\\'t tend to take stolen credit cards for duty\\npayments. In another instance, Trotsky was allegedly more successful.\\nA try-hard hacker who kept pictures of Karl Marx and Lenin taped to\\nthe side of his computer terminal, Trotsky regularly spewed communist\\ndoctrine across the underground. A self-contained paradox, he spent\\nhis time attending Communist Party of Australia meetings and duck\\nshoots. According to one hacker, Trotsky\\'s particular contribution to\\nthe overthrow of the capitalist order was the arrangement of a\\nshipment of expensive modems from the US using stolen credit cards. He\\nwas rumoured to have made a tidy profit by selling the modems in the\\ncomputer community for about $200 each. Apparently, being part of the\\ncommunist revolution gave him all sorts of ready-made\\nrationalisations. Membership has its advantages.\\n\\nTo Bowen, carding was little more than theft. Hacking may have been a\\nmoral issue, but in early 1988 in Australia it was not yet much of a\\nlegal one. Carding was by contrast both a moral and a legal issue.\\nBowen recognised that some people viewed hacking as a type of\\ntheft--stealing someone else\\'s computer resources--but the argument\\nwas ambiguous. What if no-one needed those resources at 2 a.m. on a\\ngiven night? It might be seen more as `borrowing\\' an under-used asset,\\nsince the hacker had not permanently appropriated any property. Not so\\nfor carding.\\n\\nWhat made carding even less noble was that it required the technical\\nskill of a wind-up toy. Not only was it beneath most good hackers, it\\nattracted the wrong sort of people into the hacking scene. People who\\nhad little or no respect for the early Australian underground\\'s golden\\nrules of hacking: don\\'t damage computer systems you break into\\n(including crashing them); don\\'t change the information in those\\nsystems (except for altering logs to cover your tracks); and share\\ninformation. For most early Australian hackers, visiting someone\\nelse\\'s system was a bit like visiting a national park. Leave it as you\\nfind it.\\n\\nWhile the cream seemed to rise to the top of the hacking hierarchy, it\\nwas the scum that floated at the top of the carding community. Few\\npeople in the underground typified this more completely than Blue\\nThunder, who had been hanging around the outskirts of the Melbourne\\nunderground since at least 1986. The senior hackers treated Blue\\nBlunder, as they sometimes called him, with great derision.\\n\\nHis entrance into the underground was as ignominious as that of a\\ndebutante who, delicately descending the grand steps of the ballroom,\\ntrips and tumbles head-first onto the dance floor. He picked a fight\\nwith the grande doyenne of the Melbourne underground.\\n\\nThe Real Article occupied a special place in the underground. For\\nstarters, The Real Article was a woman--perhaps the only female to\\nplay a major role in the early Melbourne underground scene. Although\\nshe didn\\'t hack computers, she knew a lot about them. She ran The Real\\nConnection, a BBS frequented by many of the hackers who hung out on\\nPI. She wasn\\'t somebody\\'s sister wafting in and out of the picture in\\nsearch of a boyfriend. She was older. She was as good as married. She\\nhad kids. She was a force to be reckoned with in the hacking\\ncommunity.\\n\\nForthright and formidable, The Real Article commanded considerable\\nrespect among the underground. A good indicator of this respect was the\\nfact that the members of H.A.C.K. had inducted her as an honorary member\\nof their exclusive club. Perhaps it was because she ran a popular\\nboard. More likely it was because, for all their bluff and bluster, most\\nhackers were young men with the problems of young men.  Being older and\\nwiser, The Real Article knew how to lend a sympathetic ear to those\\nproblems. As a woman and a non-hacker, she was removed from the jumble\\nof male ego hierarchical problems associated with confiding in a\\npeer. She served as a sort of mother to the embryonic hacking community,\\nbut she was young enough to avoid the judgmental pitfalls most parents\\nfall into with children.\\n\\nThe Real Article and Blue Thunder went into partnership running a BBS\\nin early 1986. Blue Thunder, then a high-school student, was desperate\\nto run a board, so she let him co-sysop the system. At first the\\npartnership worked. Blue Thunder used to bring his high-school essays\\nover for her to proofread and correct. But a short time into the\\npartnership, it went sour. The Real Article didn\\'t like Blue Thunder\\'s\\napproach to running a BBS, which appeared to her to be get information\\nfrom other hackers and then dump them. The specific strategy seemed to\\nbe: get hackers to logon and store their valuable information on the\\nBBS, steal that information and then lock them out of their own\\naccount. By locking them out, he was able to steal all the glory; he\\ncould then claim the hacking secrets were his own. It was, in her\\nopinion, not only unsustainable, but quite immoral. She parted ways\\nwith Blue Thunder and excommunicated him from her BBS.\\n\\nNot long after, The Real Article started getting harassing phone calls\\nat 4 in the morning. The calls were relentless. Four a.m. on the dot,\\nevery night. The voice at the other end of the line was computer\\nsynthesised. This was followed by a picture of a machine-gun, printed\\nout on a cheap dot matrix printer in Commodore ASCII, delivered in her\\nletterbox. There was a threatening message attached which read\\nsomething like, `If you want the kids to stay alive, get them out of\\nthe house\\'.\\n\\nAfter that came the brick through the window. It landed in the back of\\nher TV. Then she woke up one morning to find her phone line dead.\\nSomeone had opened the Telecom well in the nature strip across the\\nroad and cut out a metre of cable. It meant the phone lines for the\\nentire street were down.\\n\\nThe Real Article tended to rise above the petty games that whining\\nadolescent boys with bruised egos could play, but this was too much.\\nShe called in Telecom Protective Services, who put a last party\\nrelease on her phone line to trace the early-morning harassing calls.\\nShe suspected Blue Thunder was involved, but nothing was ever proved.\\nFinally, the calls stopped. She voiced her suspicions to others in the\\ncomputer underground. Whatever shred of reputation Blue Chunder, as he\\nthen became known for a time, had was soon decimated.\\n\\nSince his own technical contributions were seen by his fellow BBS\\nusers as limited, Blue Thunder would likely have faded into obscurity,\\ncondemned to spend the rest of his time in the underground jumping\\naround the ankles of the aristocratic hackers. But the birth of\\ncarding arrived at a fortuitous moment for him and he got into carding\\nin a big way, so big in fact that he soon got busted.\\n\\nPeople in the underground recognised him as a liability, both because\\nof what many hackers saw as his loose morals and because he was\\nboastful of his activities. One key hacker said, `He seemed to relish\\nthe idea of getting caught. He told people he worked for a credit\\nunion and that he stole lots of credit card numbers. He sold\\ninformation, such as accounts on systems, for financial gain.\\' In\\npartnership with a carder, he also allegedly sent a bouquet of flowers\\nto the police fraud squad--and paid for it with a stolen credit card\\nnumber.\\n\\nOn 31 August 1988, Blue Thunder faced 22 charges in the Melbourne\\nMagistrates Court, where he managed to get most of the charges dropped\\nor amalgamated. He only ended up pleading guilty to five counts,\\nincluding deception and theft. The Real Article sat in the back of the\\ncourtroom watching the proceedings. Blue Thunder must have been pretty\\nworried about what kind of sentence the magistrate would hand down\\nbecause she said he approached her during the lunch break and asked if\\nshe would appear as a character witness for the defence. She looked\\nhim straight in the eye and said, `I think you would prefer it if I\\ndidn\\'t\\'. He landed 200 hours of community service and an order to pay\\n$706 in costs.\\n\\nCraig Bowen didn\\'t like where the part of the underground typified by\\nBlue Thunder was headed. In his view, Chunder and Trotsky stood out as\\nbad apples in an otherwise healthy group, and they signalled an\\nunpleasant shift towards selling information. This was perhaps the\\ngreatest taboo. It was dirty. It was seedy. It was the realm of\\ncriminals, not explorers. The Australian computer underground had\\nstarted to lose some of its fresh-faced innocence.\\n\\nSomewhere in the midst of all this, a new player entered the Melbourne\\nunderground. His name was Stuart Gill, from a company called\\nHackwatch.\\n\\nBowen met Stuart through Kevin Fitzgerald, a well-known local hacker\\ncommentator who founded the Chisholm Institute of Technology\\'s\\nComputer Abuse Research Bureau, which later became the Australian\\nComputer Abuse Research Bureau. After seeing a newspaper article\\nquoting Fitzgerald, Craig decided to ring up the man many members of\\nthe underground considered to be a hacker-catcher. Why not? There were\\nno federal laws in Australia against hacking, so Bowen didn\\'t feel\\nthat nervous about it. Besides, he wanted to meet the enemy. No-one\\nfrom the Australian underground had ever done it before, and Bowen\\ndecided it was high time. He wanted to set the record straight with\\nFitzgerald, to let him know what hackers were really on about. They\\nbegan to talk periodically on the phone.\\n\\nAlong the way, Bowen met Stuart Gill who said that he was working with\\nFitzgerald.4 Before long, Gill began visiting PI. Eventually, Bowen\\nvisited Gill in person at the Mount Martha home he shared with his\\nelderly aunt and uncle. Stuart had all sorts of computer equipment\\nhooked up there, and a great number of boxes of papers in the garage.\\n\\n`Oh, hello there, Paul,\\' Gill\\'s ancient-looking uncle said when he saw\\nthe twosome. As soon as the old man had tottered off, Gill pulled\\nBowen aside confidentially.\\n\\n`Don\\'t worry about old Eric,\\' he said. `He lost it in the war. Today\\nhe thinks I\\'m Paul, tomorrow it will be someone else.\\'\\n\\nBowen nodded, understanding.\\n\\nThere were many strange things about Stuart Gill, all of which seemed\\nto have a rational explanation, yet that explanation somehow never\\nquite answered the question in full.\\n\\nAged in his late thirties, he was much older and far more worldly than\\nCraig Bowen. He had very, very pale skin--so pasty it looked as though\\nhe had never sat in the sun in his life.\\n\\nGill drew Bowen into the complex web of his life. Soon he told the\\nyoung hacker that he wasn\\'t just running Hackwatch, he was also\\ninvolved in intelligence work. For the Australian Federal Police. For\\nASIO. For the National Crime Authority. For the Victoria Police\\'s\\nBureau of Criminal Intelligence (BCI). He showed Bowen some secret\\ncomputer files and documents, but he made him sign a special form\\nfirst--a legal-looking document demanding non-disclosure based on some\\nsort of official secrets act.\\n\\nBowen was impressed. Why wouldn\\'t he be? Gill\\'s cloak-and-dagger world\\nlooked like the perfect boy\\'s own adventure. Even bigger and better\\nthan hacking. He was a little strange, but that was part of the\\nallure.\\n\\nLike the time they took a trip to Sale together around Christmas 1988.\\nGill told Bowen he had to get out of town for a few days--certain\\nundesirable people were after him. He didn\\'t drive, so could Craig\\nhelp him out? Sure, no problem. They had shared an inexpensive motel\\nroom in Sale, paid for by Gill.\\n\\nBeing so close to Christmas, Stuart told Craig he had brought him two\\npresents. Craig opened the first--a John Travolta fitness book. When\\nCraig opened the second gift, he was a little stunned. It was a red\\nG-string for men. Craig didn\\'t have a girlfriend at the time--perhaps\\nStuart was trying to help him get one.\\n\\n`Oh, ah, thanks,\\' Craig said, a bit confused.\\n\\n`Glad you like it,\\' Stuart said. `Go on. Try it on.\\'\\n\\n`Try it on?\\' Craig was now very confused.\\n\\n`Yeah, mate, you know, to see if it fits. That\\'s all.\\'\\n\\n`Oh, um, right.\\'\\n\\nCraig hesitated. He didn\\'t want to seem rude. It was a weird request,\\nbut never having been given a G-string before, he didn\\'t know the\\nnormal protocol. After all, when someone gives you a jumper, it\\'s\\nnormal for them to ask you to try it on, then and there, to see if it\\nfits.\\n\\nCraig tried it on. Quickly.\\n\\n`Yes, seems to fit,\\' Stuart said matter of factly, then turned away.\\n\\nCraig felt relieved. He changed back into his clothing.\\n\\nThat night, and on many others during their trips or during Craig\\'s\\novernight visits to Stuart\\'s uncle\\'s house, Craig lay in bed wondering\\nabout his secretive new friend.\\n\\nStuart was definitely a little weird, but he seemed to like women so\\nCraig figured he couldn\\'t be interested in Craig that way. Stuart\\nbragged that he had a very close relationship with a female newspaper\\nreporter, and he always seemed to be chatting up the girl at the video\\nstore.\\n\\nCraig tried not to read too much into Stuart\\'s odd behaviour, for the\\nyoung man was willing to forgive his friend\\'s eccentricities just to\\nbe part of the action. Soon Stuart asked Craig for access to\\nPI--unrestricted access.\\n\\nThe idea made Craig uncomfortable, but Stuart was so persuasive. How\\nwould he be able to continue his vital intelligence work without\\naccess to Victoria\\'s most important hacking board? Besides, Stuart\\nGill of Hackwatch wasn\\'t after innocent-faced hackers like Craig\\nBowen. In fact, he would protect Bowen when the police came down on\\neveryone. What Stuart really wanted was the carders--the fraudsters.\\nCraig didn\\'t want to protect people like that, did he?\\n\\nCraig found it a little odd, as usual, that Stuart seemed to be after\\nthe carders, yet he had chummed up with Ivan Trotsky. Still, there\\nwere no doubt secrets Stuart couldn\\'t reveal--things he wasn\\'t allowed\\nto explain because of his intelligence work.\\n\\nCraig agreed.\\n\\nWhat Craig couldn\\'t have known as he pondered Stuart Gill from the\\nsafety of his boyish bedroom was exactly how much innocence the\\nunderground was still to lose. If he had foreseen the next few\\nyears--the police raids, the Ombudsman\\'s investigation, the stream of\\nnewspaper articles and the court cases--Craig Bowen would, at that\\nvery moment, probably have reached over and turned off his beloved PI\\nand Zen forever.\\n\\n             ',\n",
       " \" 3 -- The American Connection.\\n\\n\\nUS forces give the nod; It's a setback for your country.\\n\\n-- from `US Forces', 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.\\n\\nForce had a secret. The Parmaster wanted it.\\n\\nLike most hackers, The Parmaster didn't just want the secret, he\\nneeded it. He was in that peculiar state attained by real hackers\\nwhere they will do just about anything to obtain a certain piece of\\ninformation. He was obsessed.\\n\\nOf course, it wasn't the first time The Parmaster craved a juicy piece\\nof information. Both he and Force knew all about infatuation. That's\\nhow it worked with real hackers. They didn't just fancy a titbit here\\nand there. Once they knew information about a particular system was\\navailable, that there was a hidden entrance, they chased it down\\nrelentlessly. So that was exactly what Par was doing. Chasing Force\\nendlessly, until he got what he wanted.\\n\\nIt began innocently enough as idle conversation between two giants in\\nthe computer underground in the first half of 1988. Force, the\\nwell-known Australian hacker who ran the exclusive Realm BBS in\\nMelbourne, sat chatting with Par, the American master of X.25\\nnetworks, in Germany. Neither of them was physically in Germany, but\\nAltos was.\\n\\nAltos Computer Systems in Hamburg ran a conference feature called\\nAltos Chat on one of its machines. You could call up from anywhere on\\nthe X.25 data communications network, and the company's computer would\\nlet you connect. Once connected, with a few brief keystrokes, the\\nGerman machine would drop you into a real-time, on-screen talk session\\nwith anyone else who happened to be on-line. While the rest of the\\ncompany's computer system grunted and toiled with everyday labours,\\nthis corner of the machine was reserved for live on-line chatting. For\\nfree. It was like an early form of the Internet Relay Chat. The\\ncompany probably hadn't meant to become the world's most prestigious\\nhacker hang-out, but it soon ended up doing so.\\n\\nAltos was the first significant international live chat channel, and\\nfor most hackers it was an amazing thing. The good hackers had cruised\\nthrough lots of computer networks around the world. Sometimes they\\nbumped into one another on-line and exchanged the latest gossip.\\nOccasionally, they logged into overseas BBSes, where they posted\\nmessages. But Altos was different. While underground BBSes had a\\ntendency to simply disappear one day, gone forever, Altos was always\\nthere. It was live. Instantaneous communications with a dozen other\\nhackers from all sorts of exotic places. Italy. Canada. France.\\nEngland. Israel. The US. And all these people not only shared an\\ninterest in computer networks but also a flagrant contempt for\\nauthority of any type. Instant, real-time penpals--with attitude.\\n\\nHowever, Altos was more exclusive than the average underground BBS.\\nWanna-be hackers had trouble getting into it because of the way X.25\\nnetworks were billed. Some systems on the network took reverse-charge\\nconnections--like a 1-800 number--and some, including Altos, didn't.\\nTo get to Altos you needed a company's NUI (Network User Identifier),\\nwhich was like a calling card number for the X.25 network, used to\\nbill your time on-line. Or you had to have access to a system like\\nMinerva which automatically accepted billing for all the connections\\nmade.\\n\\nX.25 networks are different in various ways from the Internet, which\\ndeveloped later. X.25 networks use different communication protocols\\nand, unlike the Internet at the user-level, they only use addresses\\ncontaining numbers not letters. Each packet of information travelling\\nover a data network needs to be encased in a particular type of\\nenvelope. A `letter' sent across the X.25 network needs an X.25\\n`stamped' envelope, not an Internet `stamped' envelope.\\n\\nThe X.25 networks were controlled by a few very large players,\\ncompanies such as Telenet and Tymnet, while the modern Internet is, by\\ncontrast, a fragmented collection of many small and medium-sized\\nsites.\\n\\nAltos unified the international hacking world as nothing else had\\ndone. In sharing information about their own countries' computers and\\nnetworks, hackers helped each other venture further and further\\nabroad. The Australians had gained quite a reputation on Altos. They\\nknew their stuff. More importantly, they possessed DEFCON, a program\\nwhich mapped out uncharted networks and scanned for accounts on\\nsystems within them. Force wrote DEFCON based on a simple automatic\\nscanning program provided by his friend and mentor, Craig Bowen\\n(Thunderbird1).\\n\\nLike the telephone system, the X.25 networks had a large number of\\n`phone numbers', called network user addresses (NUAs). Most were not\\nvalid. They simply hadn't been assigned to anyone yet. To break into\\ncomputers on the network, you had to find them first, which meant\\neither hearing about a particular system from a fellow hacker or\\nscanning. Scanning--typing in one possible address after another--was\\nworse than looking for a needle in a haystack. 02624-589004-0004. Then\\nincreasing the last digit by one on each attempt. 0005. 0006. 0007.\\nUntil you hit a machine at the other end.\\n\\nBack in 1987 or early 1988, Force had logged into Pacific Island for a\\ntalk with Craig Bowen. Force bemoaned the tediousness of hand\\nscanning.\\n\\n`Well, why the hell are you doing it manually?' Bowen responded. `You\\nshould just use my program.' He then gave Force the source code for\\nhis simple automated scanning program, along with instructions.\\n\\nForce went through the program and decided it would serve as a good\\nlaunchpad for bigger things, but it had a major limitation. The\\nprogram could only handle one connection at a time, which meant it\\ncould only scan one branch of a network at a time.\\n\\nLess than three months later, Force had rewritten Bowen's program into\\nthe far more powerful DEFCON, which became the jewel in the crown of\\nthe Australian hackers' reputation. With DEFCON, a hacker could\\nautomatically scan fifteen or twenty network addresses simultaneously.\\nHe could command the computer to map out pieces of the Belgian,\\nBritish and Greek X.25 communications networks, looking for computers\\nhanging off the networks like buds at the tips of tree branches.\\n\\nConceptually, the difference was a little like using a basic PC, which\\ncan only run one program at a time, as opposed to operating a more\\nsophisticated one where you can open many windows with different\\nprograms running all at once. Even though you might only be working in\\none window, say, writing a letter, the computer might be doing\\ncalculations in a spreadsheet in another window in the background. You\\ncan swap between\\ndifferent functions, which are all running in the background\\nsimultaneously.\\n\\nWhile DEFCON was busy scanning, Force could do other things, such as\\ntalk on Altos. He continued improving DEFCON, writing up to four more\\nversions of the program. Before long, DEFCON didn't just scan twenty\\ndifferent connections at one time; it also automatically tried to\\nbreak into all the computers it found through those connections.\\nThough the program only tried basic default passwords, it had a fair\\ndegree of success, since it could attack so many network addresses at\\nonce. Further, new sites and mini-networks were being added so quickly\\nthat security often fell by the wayside in the rush to join in. Since\\nthe addresses were unpublished, companies often felt this obscurity\\noffered enough protection.\\n\\nDEFCON produced lists of thousands of computer sites to raid. Force\\nwould leave it scanning from a hacked Prime computer, and a day or two\\nlater he would have an output file with 6000 addresses on different\\nnetworks. He perused the list and selected sites which caught his\\nattention. If his program had discovered an interesting address, he\\nwould travel over the X.25 network to the site and then try to break\\ninto the computer at that address. Alternatively, DEFCON might have\\nalready successfully penetrated the machine using a default password,\\nin which case the address, account name and password would all be\\nwaiting for Force in the log file. He could just walk right in.\\n\\nEveryone on Altos wanted DEFCON, but Force refused to hand over the\\nprogram. No way was he going to have other hackers tearing up virgin\\nnetworks. Not even Erik Bloodaxe, one of the leaders of the most\\nprestigious American hacking group, Legion of Doom (LOD), got DEFCON\\nwhen he asked for it. Erik took his handle from the name of a Viking\\nking who ruled over the area now known as York, England. Although Erik\\nwas on friendly terms with the Australian hackers, Force remained\\nadamant. He would not let the jewel out of his hands.\\n\\nBut on this fateful day in 1988, Par didn't want DEFCON. He wanted the\\nsecret Force had just discovered, but held so very close to his chest.\\nAnd the Australian didn't want to give it to him.\\n\\nForce was a meticulous hacker. His bedroom was remarkably tidy, for a\\nhacker's room. It had a polished, spartan quality. There were a few\\nwell-placed pieces of minimalist furniture:\\na black enamel metal single bed, a modern black bedside\\ntable and a single picture on the wall--a photographic poster of\\nlightning, framed in glass. The largest piece of furniture was a\\nblue-grey desk with a return, upon which sat his computer, a printer\\nand an immaculate pile of print-outs. The bookcase, a tall modern\\npiece matching the rest of the furniture, contained an extensive\\ncollection of fantasy fiction books, including what seemed to be\\nalmost everything ever written by David Eddings. The lower shelves\\nhoused assorted chemistry and programming books. A chemistry award\\nproudly jutted out from the shelf housing a few Dungeons and Dragons\\nbooks.\\n\\nHe kept his hacking notes in an orderly set of plastic folders, all\\nfiled in the bottom of his bookcase. Each page of notes, neatly\\nprinted and surrounded by small, tidy handwriting revealing updates\\nand minor corrections, had its own plastic cover to prevent smudges or\\nstains.\\n\\nForce thought it was inefficient to hand out his DEFCON program and\\nhave ten people scan the same network ten different times. It wasted\\ntime and resources. Further, it was becoming harder to get access to\\nthe main X.25 sites in Australia, like Minerva. Scanning was the type\\nof activity likely to draw the attention of a system admin and result\\nin the account being killed. The more people who scanned, the more\\naccounts would be killed, and the less access the Australian hackers\\nwould have. So Force refused to hand over DEFCON to hackers outside\\nThe Realm, which is one thing that made it such a powerful group.\\n\\nScanning with DEFCON meant using Netlink, a program which legitimate\\nusers didn't often employ. In his hunt for hackers, an admin might\\nlook for people running Netlink, or he might just examine which\\nsystems a user was connecting to. For example, if a hacker connected\\ndirectly to Altos from Minerva without hopping through a respectable\\nmidpoint, such as another corporate machine overseas, he could count\\non the Minerva admins killing off the account.\\n\\nDEFCON was revolutionary for its time, and difficult to reproduce. It\\nwas written for Prime computers, and not many hackers knew how to\\nwrite programs for Primes. In fact, it was exceedingly difficult for\\nmost hackers to learn programming of any sort for large, commercial\\nmachines. Getting the system engineering manuals was tough work and\\nmany of the large companies guarded their manuals almost as trade\\nsecrets. Sure, if you bought a $100000 system, the company would give\\nyou a few sets of operating manuals, but that was well beyond the\\nreach of a teenage hacker. In general, information was hoarded--by the\\ncomputer manufacturers, by the big companies which bought the systems,\\nby the system administrators and even by the universities.\\n\\nLearning on-line was slow and almost as difficult. Most hackers used\\n300 or 1200 baud modems. Virtually all access to these big, expensive\\nmachines was illegal. Every moment on-line was a risky proposition.\\nHigh schools never had these sorts of expensive machines. Although\\nmany universities had systems, the administrators were usually miserly\\nwith time on-line for students. In most cases, students only got\\naccounts on the big machines in their second year of computer science\\nstudies. Even then, student accounts were invariably on the\\nuniversity's oldest, clunkiest machine. And if you weren't a comp-sci\\nstudent, forget it. Indulging your intellectual curiosity in VMS\\nsystems would never be anything more than a pipe dream.\\n\\nEven if you did manage to overcome all the roadblocks and develop some\\nprogramming experience in VMS systems, for example, you might only be\\nable to access a small number of machines on any given network. The\\nX.25 networks connected a large number of machines which used very\\ndifferent operating systems. Many, such as Primes, were not in the\\nleast bit intuitive. So if you knew VMS and you hit a Prime machine,\\nwell, that was pretty much it.\\n\\nUnless, of course, you happened to belong to a clan of hackers like\\nThe Realm. Then you could call up the BBS and post a message. `Hey, I\\nfound a really cool Primos system at this address. Ran into problems\\ntrying to figure the parameters of the Netlink command. Ideas anyone?'\\nAnd someone from your team would step forward to help.\\n\\nIn The Realm, Force tried to assemble a diverse group of Australia's\\nbest hackers, each with a different area of expertise. And he happened\\nto be the resident expert in Prime computers.\\n\\nAlthough Force wouldn't give DEFCON to anyone outside The Realm, he\\nwasn't unreasonable. If you weren't in the system but you had an\\ninteresting network you wanted mapped, he would scan it for you. Force\\nreferred to scans for network user addresses as `NUA sprints'. He\\nwould give you a copy of the NUA sprint. While he was at it, he would\\nalso keep a copy for The Realm. That was efficient. Force's pet\\nproject was creating a database of systems and networks for The Realm,\\nso he simply added the new information to its database.\\n\\nForce's great passion was mapping new networks, and new mini-networks\\nwere being added to the main X.25 networks all the time. A large\\ncorporation, such a BHP, might set up its own small-scale network\\nconnecting its offices in Western Australia, Queensland, Victoria and\\nthe United Kingdom. That mini-network might be attached to a\\nparticular X.25 network, such as Austpac. Get into the Austpac network\\nand chances were you could get into any of the company's sites.\\n\\nExploration of all this uncharted territory consumed most of Force's\\ntime. There was something cutting-edge, something truly adventurous\\nabout finding a new network and carefully piecing together a picture\\nof what the expanding web looked like. He drew detailed pictures and\\ndiagrams showing how a new part of the network connected to the rest.\\nPerhaps it appealed to his sense of order, or maybe he was just an\\nadventurer at heart. Whatever the underlying motivation, the maps\\nprovided The Realm with yet another highly prized asset.\\n\\nWhen he wasn't mapping networks, Force published Australia's first\\nunderground hacking journal, Globetrotter. Widely read in the\\ninternational hacking community, Globetrotter reaffirmed Australian\\nhackers' pre-eminent position in the international underground.\\n\\nBut on this particular day, Par wasn't thinking about getting a copy\\nof Globetrotter or asking Force to scan a network for him. He was\\nthinking about that secret. Force's new secret. The secret Parmaster\\ndesperately wanted.\\n\\nForce had been using DEFCON to scan half a dozen networks while he\\nchatted to Par on Altos. He found an interesting connection from the\\nscan, so he went off to investigate it. When he connected to the\\nunknown computer, it started firing off strings of numbers at Force's\\nmachine. Force sat at his desk and watched the characters rush by on\\nhis screen.\\n\\nIt was very odd. He hadn't done anything. He hadn't sent any commands\\nto the mystery computer. He hadn't made the slightest attempt to break\\ninto the machine. Yet here the thing was throwing streams of numbers.\\nWhat kind of computer was this? There might have been some sort of\\nheader which would identify the computer, but it had zoomed by so fast\\nin the unexpected data dump that Force had missed it.\\n\\nForce flipped over to his chat with Par on Altos. He didn't completely\\ntrust Par, thinking the friendly American sailed a bit close to the\\nwind. But Par was an expert in X.25 networks and was bound to have\\nsome clue about these numbers. Besides, if they turned out to be\\nsomething sensitive, Force didn't have to tell Par where he found\\nthem.\\n\\n`I've just found a bizarre address. It is one strange system. When I\\nconnected, it just started shooting off numbers at me. Check these\\nout.'\\n\\nForce didn't know what the numbers were, but Par sure did. `Those look\\nlike credit cards,' he typed back.\\n\\n`Oh.' Force went quiet.\\n\\nPar thought the normally chatty Australian hacker seemed astonished.\\nAfter a short silence, the now curious Par nudged the conversation\\nforward. `I have a way I can check out whether they really are valid\\ncards,' he volunteered. `It'll take some time, but I should be able to\\ndo it and get back to you.'\\n\\n`Yes.' Force seemed hesitant. `OK.'\\n\\nOn the other side of the Pacific from Par, Force thought about this\\nturn of events. If they were valid credit cards, that was very cool.\\nNot because he intended to use them for credit card fraud in the way\\nIvan Trotsky might have done. But Force could use them for making\\nlong-distance phone calls to hack overseas. And the sheer number of\\ncards was astonishing. Thousand and thousands of them. Maybe 10000.\\nAll he could think was, s**t! Free connections for the rest of my\\nlife.\\n\\nHackers such as Force considered using cards to call overseas computer\\nsystems a little distasteful, but certainly acceptable. The card owner\\nwould never end up paying the bill anyway. The hackers figured that\\nTelecom, which they despised, would probably have to wear the cost in\\nthe end, and that was fine by them. Using cards to hack was nothing\\nlike ordering consumer goods. That was real credit card fraud. And\\nForce would never sully his hands with that sort of behaviour.\\n\\nForce scrolled back over his capture of the numbers which had been\\ninjected into his machine. After closer inspection, he saw there were\\nheaders which appeared periodically through the list. One said,\\n`CitiSaudi'.\\n\\nHe checked the prefix of the mystery machine's network address again.\\nHe knew from previous scans that it belonged to one of the world's\\nlargest banks. Citibank.\\n\\nThe data dump continued for almost three hours. After that, the\\nCitibank machine seemed to go dead. Force saw nothing but a blank\\nscreen, but he kept the connection open. There was no way he was going\\nto hang up from this conversation. He figured this had to be a freak\\nconnection--that he accidentally connected to this machine somehow,\\nthat it wasn't really at the address he had tried based on the DEFCON\\nscan of Citibank's network.\\n\\nHow else could it have happened? Surely Citibank wouldn't have a\\ncomputer full of credit cards which spilled its guts every time\\nsomeone rang up to say `hello'? There would be tonnes of security on a\\nmachine like that. This machine didn't even have a password. It didn't\\neven need a special character command, like a secret handshake.\\n\\nFreak connections happened now and then on X.25\\nnetworks. They had the same effect as a missed voice phone\\nconnection. You dial a friend's number--and you dial it correctly--but\\nsomehow the call gets screwed up in the tangle of wires and exchanges\\nand your call gets put through to another number entirely. Of course,\\nonce something like that happens to an X.25 hacker, he immediately\\ntries to figure out what the hell is going on, to search every shred\\nof data from the machine looking for the system's real address.\\nBecause it was an accident, he suspects he will never find the machine\\nagain.\\n\\nForce stayed home from school for two days to keep the connection\\nalive and to piece together how he landed on the doorstep of this\\ncomputer. During this time, the Citibank computer woke up a few times,\\ndumped a bit more information, and then went back to sleep. Keeping\\nthe connection alive meant running a small risk of discovery by an\\nadmin at his launch point, but the rewards in this case far exceeded\\nthe risk.\\n\\nIt wasn't all that unusual for Force to skip school to hack. His\\nparents used to tell him, `You better stop it, or you'll have to wear\\nglasses one day'. Still, they didn't seem to worry too much, since\\ntheir son had always excelled in school without much effort. At the\\nstart of his secondary school career he had tried to convince his\\nteachers he should skip year 9. Some objected. It was a hassle, but he\\nfinally arranged it by quietly doing the coursework for year 9 while\\nhe was in year 8.\\n\\nAfter Force had finally disconnected from the CitiSaudi computer and\\nhad a good sleep, he decided to check on whether he could reconnect to\\nthe machine. At first, no-one answered, but when he tried a little\\nlater, someone answered all right. And it was the same talkative\\nresident who answered the door the first time. Although it only seemed\\nto work at certain hours of the day, the Citibank network address was\\nthe right one. He was in again.\\n\\nAs Force looked over the captures from his Citibank hack, he noticed\\nthat the last section of the data dump didn't contain credit card\\nnumbers like the first part. It had people's names--Middle Eastern\\nnames--and a list of transactions. Dinner at a restaurant. A visit to\\na brothel. All sorts of transactions. There was also a number which\\nlooked like a credit limit, in come cases a very, very large limit,\\nfor each person. A sheik and his wife appeared to have credit limits\\nof $1 million--each. Another name had a limit of $5 million.\\n\\nThere was something strange about the data, Force thought. It was not\\nstructured in a way which suggested the Citibank machine was merely\\ntransmitting data to another machine. It looked more like a text file\\nwhich was being dumped from a computer to a line printer.\\n\\nForce sat back and considered his exquisite discovery. He decided this\\nwas something he would share only with a very few close, trusted\\nfriends from The Realm. He would tell Phoenix and perhaps one other\\nmember, but no-one else.\\n\\nAs he looked through the data once more, Force began to feel a little\\nanxious. Citibank was a huge financial institution, dependent on the\\ncomplete confidence of its customers. The corporation would lose a lot\\nof face if news of Force's discovery got out. It might care enough to\\nreally come after him. Then, with the sudden clarity of the lightning\\nstrike photo which hung on his wall, a single thought filled his mind.\\n\\nI am playing with fire.\\n\\n\\n`Where did you get those numbers?' Par asked Force next time they were\\nboth on Altos.\\n\\nForce hedged. Par leaped forward.\\n\\n`I checked those numbers for you. They're valid,' he told Force. The\\nAmerican was more than intrigued. He wanted that network address. It\\nwas lust. Next stop, mystery machine. `So, what's the address?'\\n\\nThat was the one question Force didn't want to hear. He and Par had a\\ngood relationship, sharing information comfortably if occasionally.\\nBut that relationship only went so far. For all he knew, Par might\\nhave a less than desirable use for the information. Force didn't know\\nif Par carded, but he felt sure Par had friends who might be into it.\\nSo Force refused to tell Par where to find the mystery machine.\\n\\nPar wasn't going to give up all that easily. Not that he would use the\\ncards for free cash, but, hey, the mystery machine seemed like a very\\ncool place to check out. There would be no peace for Force until Par\\ngot what he wanted. Nothing is so tempting to a hacker as the faintest\\nwhiff of information about a system he wants, and Par hounded Force\\nuntil the Australian hacker relented just a bit.\\n\\nFinally Force told Par roughly where DEFCON had been scanning for\\naddresses when it stumbled upon the CitiSaudi machine. Force wasn't\\nhanding over the street address, just the name of the suburb. DEFCON\\nhad been accessing the Citibank network through Telenet, a large\\nAmerican data network using X.25 communications protocols. The\\nsub-prefixes for the Citibank portion of the network were 223 and 224.\\n\\nPar pestered Force some more for the rest of the numbers, but the\\nAustralian had dug his heels in. Force was too careful a player, too\\nfastidious a hacker, to allow himself to get mixed up in the things\\nPar might get up to.\\n\\nOK, thought the seventeen-year-old Par, I can do this without you. Par\\nestimated there were 20000 possible addresses on that network, any one\\nof which might be the home of the mystery machine. But he assumed the\\nmachine would be in the low end of the network, since the lower\\nnumbers were usually used first and the higher numbers were generally\\nsaved for other, special network functions. His assumptions narrowed\\nthe likely search field to about 2000 possible addresses.\\n\\nPar began hand-scanning on the Citibank Global Telecommunications\\nNetwork (GTN) looking for the mystery machine. Using his knowledge of\\nthe X.25 network, he picked a number to start with. He typed 22301,\\n22302, 22303. On and on, heading toward 22310000. Hour after hour,\\nslowly, laboriously, working his way through all the options, Par\\nscanned out a piece, or a range, within the network. When he got bored\\nwith the 223 prefix, he tried out the 224 one for a bit of variety.\\n\\nBleary-eyed and exhausted after a long night at the computer, Par felt\\nlike calling it quits. The sun had splashed through the windows of his\\nSalinas, California, apartment hours ago. His living room was a mess,\\nwith empty, upturned beer cans circling his Apple IIe. Par gave up for\\na while, caught some shut-eye. He had gone through the entire list of\\npossible addresses, knocking at all the doors, and nothing had\\nhappened. But over the next few days he returned to scanning the\\nnetwork again. He decided to be more methodical about it and do the\\nwhole thing from scratch a second time.\\n\\nHe was part way through the second scan when it happened. Par's\\ncomputer connected to something. He sat up and peered toward the\\nscreen. What was going on? He checked the address. He was sure he had\\ntried this one before and nothing had answered. Things were definitely\\ngetting strange. He stared at his computer.\\n\\nThe screen was blank, with the cursor blinking silently at the top.\\nNow what? What had Force done to get the computer to sing its song?\\n\\nPar tried pressing the control key and a few different letters.\\nNothing. Maybe this wasn't the right address after all. He\\ndisconnected from the machine and carefully wrote down the address,\\ndetermined to try it again later.\\n\\nOn his third attempt, he connected again but found the same irritating\\nblank screen. This time he went through the entire alphabet with the\\ncontrol key.\\n\\nControl L.\\n\\nThat was the magic keystroke. The one that made CitiSaudi give up its\\nmysterious cache. The one that gave Par an adrenalin rush, along with\\nthousands and thousands of cards. Instant cash, flooding his screen.\\nHe turned on the screen capture so he could collect all the\\ninformation flowing past and analyse it later. Par had to keep feeding\\nhis little Apple IIe more disks to store all the data coming in\\nthrough his 1200 baud modem.\\n\\nIt was magnificent. Par savoured the moment, thinking about how much\\nhe was going to enjoy telling Force. It was going to be sweet. Hey,\\nAussie, you aren't the only show in town. See ya in Citibank.\\n\\nAn hour or so later, when the CitiSaudi data dump had finally\\nfinished, Par was stunned at what he found in his capture. These\\nweren't just any old cards. These were debit cards, and they were held\\nby very rich Arabs. These people just plopped a few million in a bank\\naccount and linked a small, rectangular piece of plastic to that\\naccount. Every charge came directly out of the bank balance. One guy\\nlisted in the data dump bought a $330,000 Mercedes Benz in\\nIstanbul--on his card. Par couldn't imagine being able to throw down a\\nbit of plastic for that. Taking that plastic out for a spin around the\\nblock would bring a whole new meaning to the expression, `Charge it!'\\n\\nWhen someone wins the lottery, they often feel like sharing with their\\nfriends. Which is exactly what Par did. First, he showed his\\nroom-mates. They thought it was very cool. But not nearly so cool as\\nthe half dozen hackers and phreakers who happened to be on the\\ntelephone bridge Par frequented when the master of X.25 read off a\\nbunch of the cards.\\n\\nPar was a popular guy after that day. Par was great, a sort of Robin\\nHood of the underground. Soon, everyone wanted to talk to him. Hackers\\nin New York. Phreakers in Virginia. And the Secret Service in San\\nFrancisco.\\n\\n\\nPar didn't mean to fall in love with Theorem. It was an accident, and\\nhe couldn't have picked a worse girl to fall for. For starters, she\\nlived in Switzerland. She was 23 and he was only seventeen. She also\\nhappened to be in a relationship--and that relationship was with\\nElectron, one of the best Australian hackers of the late 1980s. But\\nPar couldn't help himself. She was irresistible, even though he had\\nnever met her in person. Theorem was different. She was smart and\\nfunny, but refined, as a European woman can be.\\n\\nThey met on Altos in 1988.\\n\\nTheorem didn't hack computers. She didn't need to, since she could\\nconnect to Altos through her old university computer account. She had\\nfirst found Altos on 23 December 1986. She remembered the date for two\\nreasons. First, she was amazed\\nat the power of Altos--that she could have a live conversation on-line\\nwith a dozen people in different countries at the same time. Altos was\\na whole new world for her. Second, that was the day she met Electron.\\n\\nElectron made Theorem laugh. His sardonic, irreverent humour hit a\\nchord with her. Traditional Swiss society could be stifling and\\nclosed, but Electron was a breath of fresh air. Theorem was Swiss but\\nshe didn't always fit the mould. She hated skiing. She was six feet\\ntall. She liked computers.\\n\\nWhen they met on-line, the 21-year-old Theorem was at a crossroad in\\nher youth. She had spent a year and a half at university studying\\nmathematics. Unfortunately, the studies had not gone well. The truth\\nbe told, her second year of university was in fact the first year all\\nover again. A classmate had introduced her to Altos on the\\nuniversity's computers. Not long after she struck up a relationship\\nwith Electron, she dropped out of uni all together and enrolled in a\\nsecretarial course. After that, she found a secretarial job at a\\nfinancial institution.\\n\\nTheorem and Electron talked on Altos for hours at a time. They talked\\nabout everything--life, family, movies, parties--but not much about\\nwhat most people on Altos talked about--hacking. Eventually, Electron\\ngathered up the courage to ask Theorem for her voice telephone number.\\nShe gave it to him happily and Electron called her at home in\\nLausanne. They talked. And talked. And talked. Soon they were on the\\ntelephone all the time.\\n\\nSeventeen-year-old Electron had never had a girlfriend. None of the\\ngirls in his middle-class high school would give him the time of day\\nwhen it came to romance. Yet here was this bright, vibrant girl--a\\ngirl who studied maths--speaking to him intimately in a melting French\\naccent. Best of all, she genuinely liked him. A few words from his\\nlips could send her into silvery peals of laughter.\\n\\nWhen the phone bill arrived, it was $1000. Electron surreptitiously\\ncollected it and buried it at the bottom of a drawer in his bedroom.\\n\\nWhen he told Theorem, she offered to help pay for it. A cheque for\\n$700 showed up not long after. It made the task of explaining\\nTelecom's reminder notice to his father much easier.\\n\\nThe romantic relationship progressed throughout 1987 and the first\\nhalf of 1988. Electron and Theorem exchanged love letters and tender\\nintimacies over 16000 kilometres of computer networks, but the\\nlong-distance relationship had some bumpy periods. Like when she had\\nan affair over several months with Pengo. A well-known German hacker\\nwith links to the German hacking group called the Chaos Computer Club,\\nPengo was also a friend and mentor to Electron. Pengo was, however,\\nonly a short train ride away from Theorem. She became friends with\\nPengo on Altos and eventually visited him. Things progressed from\\nthere.\\n\\nTheorem was honest with Electron about the affair, but there was\\nsomething unspoken, something below the surface. Even after the affair\\nended, Theorem was sweet on Pengo the way a girl remains fond of her\\nfirst love regardless of how many other men she has slept with since\\nthen.\\n\\nElectron felt hurt and angry, but he swallowed his pride and forgave\\nTheorem her dalliance. Eventually, Pengo disappeared from the scene.\\n\\nPengo had been involved with people who sold US military\\nsecrets--taken from computers--to the KGB. Although his direct\\ninvolvement in the ongoing international computer espionage had been\\nlimited, he began to worry about the risks. His real interest was in\\nhacking, not spying. The Russian connection simply enabled him to get\\naccess to bigger and better computers. Beyond that, he felt no loyalty\\nto the Russians.\\n\\nIn the first half of 1988, he handed himself in to the German\\nauthorities. Under West German law at the time, a citizen-spy who\\nsurrendered himself before the state discovered the crime, and thus\\naverted more damage to the state, acquired immunity from prosecution.\\nHaving already been busted in December 1986 for using a stolen NUI,\\nPengo decided that turning himself in would be his best hope of taking\\nadvantage of this legal largesse.\\n\\nBy the end of the year, things had become somewhat hairy for Pengo and\\nin March 1989 the twenty-year-old from Berlin was raided again, this\\ntime with the four others involved in the spy ring. The story broke\\nand the media exposed Pengo's real name. He didn't know if he would\\neventually be tried and convicted of something related to the\\nincident. Pengo had a few things on his mind other than the six-foot\\nSwiss girl.\\n\\nWith Pengo out of the way, the situation between Theorem and the\\nAustralian hacker improved. Until Par came along.\\n\\nTheorem and Par began innocently enough. Being one of only a few girls\\nin the international hacking and phreaking scene and, more\\nparticularly, on Altos, she was treated differently. She had lots of\\nmale friends on the German chat system, and the boys told her things\\nin confidence they would never tell each other. They sought out her\\nadvice. She often felt like she wore many hats--mother, girlfriend,\\npsychiatrist--when she spoke with the boys on Altos.\\n\\nPar had been having trouble with his on-line girlfriend, Nora, and\\nwhen he met Theorem he turned to her for a bit of support. He had\\ntravelled from California to meet Nora in person in New York. But when\\nhe arrived in the sweltering heat of a New York summer, without\\nwarning, her conservative Chinese parents didn't take kindly to his\\nunannounced appearance. There were other frictions between Nora and\\nPar. The relationship had been fine on Altos and on the phone, but\\nthings were just not clicking in person.\\n\\nHe already knew that virtual relationships, forged over an electronic\\nmedium which denied the importance of physical chemistry, could\\nsometimes be disappointing.\\n\\nPar used to hang out on a phone bridge with another Australian member\\nof The Realm, named Phoenix, and with a fun girl from southern\\nCalifornia. Tammi, a casual phreaker, had a great personality and a\\nhilarious sense of humour. During those endless hours chatting, she\\nand Phoenix seemed to be in the throes of a mutual crush. In the\\nphreaking underground, they were known as a bit of a virtual item. She\\nhad even invited Phoenix to come visit her sometime. Then, one day,\\nfor the fun of it, Tammi decided to visit Par in Monterey. Her\\nappearance was a shock.\\n\\nTammi had described herself to Phoenix as being a blue-eyed, blonde\\nCalifornia girl. Par knew that Phoenix visualised her as a\\nstereotypical bikini-clad, beach bunny from LA. His perception rested\\non a foreigner's view of the southern California culture. The land of\\nmilk and honey. The home of the Beach Boys and TV series like\\n`Charlie's Angels'.\\n\\nWhen Tammi arrived, Par knew instantly that she and Phoenix would\\nnever hit it off in person. Tammi did in fact have both blonde hair\\nand blue eyes. She had neglected to mention, however, that she weighed\\nabout 300 pounds, had a rather homely face and a somewhat down-market\\nstyle. Par really liked Tammi, but he couldn't get the ugly phrase\\n`white trash' out of his thoughts. He pushed and shoved, but the\\nphrase was wedged in his mind. It fell to Par to tell Phoenix the\\ntruth about Tammi.\\n\\nSo Par knew all about how reality could burst the foundations of a\\nvirtual relationship.\\n\\nLeaving New York and Nora behind, Par moved across the river to New\\nJersey to stay with a friend, Byteman, who was one of a group of\\nhackers who specialised in breaking into computer systems run by Bell\\nCommunications Research (Bellcore). Bellcore came into existence at\\nthe beginning of 1984 as a result of the break-up of the US telephone\\nmonopoly known as Bell Systems. Before the break-up, Bell Systems'\\npaternalistic holding company, American Telephone and Telegraph\\n(AT&T), had\\nfostered the best and brightest in Bell Labs, its research arm. Over\\nthe course of its history, Bell Labs boasted at least seven\\nNobel-prize winning researchers and numerous scientific achievements.\\nAll of which made Bellcore a good target for hackers trying to prove\\ntheir prowess.\\n\\nByteman used to chat with Theorem on Altos, and eventually he called\\nher, voice. Par must have looked pretty inconsolable, because one day\\nwhile Byteman was talking to Theorem, he suddenly said to her, `Hey,\\nwanna talk to a friend of mine?' Theorem said `Sure' and Byteman\\nhanded the telephone to Par. They talked for about twenty minutes.\\n\\nAfter that they spoke regularly both on Altos and on the phone. For\\nweeks after Par returned to California, Theorem tried to cheer him up\\nafter his unfortunate experience with Nora. By mid-1988, they had\\nfallen utterly and passionately in love.\\n\\nElectron, an occasional member of Force's Realm group, took the news\\nvery badly. Not everyone on Altos liked Electron. He could be a little\\nprickly, and very cutting when he chose to be, but he was an ace\\nhacker, on an international scale, and everyone listened to him.\\nObsessive, creative and quick off the mark, Electron had respect,\\nwhich is one reason Par felt so badly.\\n\\nWhen Theorem told Electron the bad news in a private conversation\\non-line, Electron had let fly in the public area, ripping into the\\nAmerican hacker on the main chat section of Altos, in front of\\neveryone.\\n\\nPar took it on the chin and refused to fight back. What else could he\\ndo? He knew what it was like to hurt. He felt for the guy and knew how\\nhe would feel if he lost Theorem. And he knew that Electron must be\\nsuffering a terrible loss of face. Everyone saw Electron and Theorem\\nas an item. They had been together for more than a year. So Par met\\nElectron's fury with grace and quiet words of consolation.\\n\\nPar didn't hear much from Electron after that day. The Australian\\nstill visited Altos, but he seemed more withdrawn, at least whenever\\nPar was around. After that day, Par ran into him once, on a phone\\nbridge with a bunch of Australian hackers.\\n\\nPhoenix said on the bridge, `Hey, Electron. Par's on the bridge.'\\n\\nElectron paused. `Oh, really,' he answered coolly. Then he went\\nsilent.\\n\\nPar let Electron keep his distance. After all, Par had what really\\ncounted--the girl.\\n\\nPar called Theorem almost every day. Soon they began to make plans for\\nher to fly to California so they could meet in person. Par tried not\\nto expect too much, but he found it difficult to stop savouring the\\nthought of finally seeing Theorem face to face. It gave him\\nbutterflies.\\n\\nYeah, Par thought, things are really looking up.\\n\\nThe beauty of Altos was that, like Pacific Island or any other local\\nBBS, a hacker could take on any identity he wanted. And he could do it\\non an international scale. Visiting Altos was like attending a\\nglittering masquerade ball. Anyone could recreate himself. A socially\\ninept hacker could pose as a character of romance and adventure. And a\\nsecurity official could pose as a hacker.\\n\\nWhich is exactly what Telenet security officer Steve Mathews did on 27\\nOctober 1988. Par happened to be on-line, chatting away with his\\nfriends and hacker colleagues. At any given moment, there were always\\na few strays on Altos, a few people who weren't regulars. Naturally,\\nMathews didn't announce himself as being a Telenet guy. He just\\nslipped quietly onto Altos looking like any other hacker. He might\\nengage a hacker in conversation, but he let the hacker do most of the\\ntalking. He was there to listen.\\n\\nOn that fateful day, Par happened to be in one of his magnanimous\\nmoods. Par had never had much money growing up, but he was always very\\ngenerous with what he did have. He talked for a little while with the\\nunknown hacker on Altos, and then gave him one of the debit cards\\ntaken from his visits to the CitiSaudi computer. Why not? On Altos, it\\nwas a bit like handing out your business card. `The\\nParmaster--Parameters Par Excellence'.\\n\\nPar had got his full name--The Parmaster--in his earliest hacking\\ndays. Back then, he belonged to a group of teenagers involved in\\nbreaking the copy protections on software programs for Apple IIes,\\nparticularly games. Par had a special gift for working out the copy\\nprotection parameters, which was a first step in bypassing the\\nmanufacturers' protection schemes. The ringleader of the group began\\ncalling him `the master of parameters'--The Parmaster--Par, for short.\\nAs he moved into serious hacking and developed his expertise in X.25\\nnetworks, he kept the name because it fitted nicely in his new\\nenvironment. `Par?' was a common command on an X.25 pad, the modem\\ngateway to an X.25 network.\\n\\n`I've got lots more where that come from,' Par told the stranger on\\nAltos. `I've got like 4000 cards from a Citibank system.'\\n\\nNot long after that, Steve Mathews was monitoring Altos again, when\\nPar showed up handing out cards to people once more.\\n\\n`I've got an inside contact,' Par confided. `He's gonna make up a\\nwhole mess of new, plastic cards with all these valid numbers from the\\nCitibank machine. Only the really big accounts, though. Nothing with a\\nbalance under $25000.'\\n\\nWas Par just making idle conversation, talking big on Altos? Or would\\nhe really have gone through with committing such a major fraud?\\nCitibank, Telenet and the US Secret Service would never know, because\\ntheir security guys began closing the net around Par before he had a\\nchance to take his idea any further.\\n\\nMathews contacted Larry Wallace, fraud investigator with Citibank in\\nSan Mateo, California. Wallace checked out the cards. They were valid\\nall right. They belonged to the Saudi-American Bank in Saudi Arabia\\nand were held on a Citibank database in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.\\nWallace determined that, with its affiliation to the Middle Eastern\\nbank, Citibank had a custodial responsibility for the accounts. That\\nmeant he could open a major investigation.\\n\\nOn 7 November, Wallace brought in the US Secret Service. Four days\\nlater, Wallace and Special Agent Thomas Holman got their first major\\nlead when they interviewed Gerry Lyons of Pacific Bell's security\\noffice in San Francisco.\\n\\nYes, Lyons told the investigators, she had some information they might\\nfind valuable. She knew all about hackers and phreakers. In fact, the\\nSan Jose Police had just busted two guys trying to phreak at a pay\\nphone. The phreakers seemed to know something about a Citibank system.\\n\\nWhen the agents showed up at the San Jose Police Department for their\\nappointment with Sergeant Dave Flory, they received another pleasant\\nsurprise. The sergeant had a book filled with hackers' names and\\nnumbers seized during the arrest of the two pay-phone phreakers. He\\nalso happened to be in possession of a tape recording of the phreakers\\ntalking to Par from a prison phone.\\n\\nThe cheeky phreakers had used the prison pay phone to call up a\\ntelephone bridge located at the University of Virginia. Par, the\\nAustralian hackers and other assorted American phreakers and hackers\\nvisited the bridge frequently. At any one moment, there might be eight\\nto ten people from the underground sitting on the bridge. The\\nphreakers found Par hanging out there, as usual, and they warned him.\\nHis name and number were inside the book seized by police when they\\nwere busted.\\n\\nPar didn't seem worried at all.\\n\\n`Hey, don't worry. It's cool,' he reassured them. `I have just\\ndisconnected my phone number today--with no forwarding details.'\\n\\nWhich wasn't quite true. His room-mate, Scott, had indeed disconnected\\nthe phone which was in his name because he had been getting prank\\ncalls. However, Scott opened a new telephone account at the same\\naddress with the same name on the same day--all of which made the job\\nof tracking down the mysterious hacker named Par much easier for the\\nlaw enforcement agencies.\\n\\nIn the meantime, Larry Wallace had been ringing around his contacts in\\nthe security business and had come up with another lead. Wanda Gamble,\\nsupervisor for the Southeastern Region of MCI Investigations, in\\nAtlanta, had a wealth of information on the hacker who called himself\\nPar. She was well connected when it came to hackers, having acquired a\\ncollection of reliable informants during her investigations of\\nhacker-related incidents. She gave the Citibank investigator two\\nmailbox numbers for Par. She also handed them what she believed was\\nhis home phone number.\\n\\nThe number checked out and on 25 November, the day after Thanksgiving,\\nthe Secret Service raided Par's house. The raid was terrifying. At\\nleast four law enforcement officers burst through the door with guns\\ndrawn and pointed. One of them had a shotgun. As is often the case in\\nthe US, investigators from private, commercial organisations--in this\\ncase Citibank and Pacific Bell--also took part in the raid.\\n\\nThe agents tore the place apart looking for evidence. They dragged\\ndown the food from the kitchen cupboards. They emptied the box of\\ncornflakes into the sink looking for hidden computer disks. They\\nlooked everywhere, even finding a ceiling cavity at the back of a\\ncloset which no-one even knew existed.\\n\\nThey confiscated Par's Apple IIe, printer and modem. But, just to be\\nsure, they also took the Yellow Pages, along with the telephone and\\nthe new Nintendo game paddles Scott had just bought. They scooped up\\nthe very large number of papers which had been piled under the coffee\\ntable, including the spiral notebook with Scott's airline bookings\\nfrom his job as a travel agent. They even took the garbage.\\n\\nIt wasn't long before they found the red shoebox full of disks peeping\\nout from under the fish tank next to Par's computer.\\n\\nThey found lots of evidence. What they didn't find was Par.\\n\\nInstead, they found Scott and Ed, two friends of Par. They were pretty\\nshaken up by the raid. Not knowing Par's real identity, the Secret\\nService agents accused Scott of being Par. The phone was in his name,\\nand Special Agent Holman had even conducted some surveillance more\\nthan a week before the raid, running the plates on Scott's 1965 black\\nFord Mustang parked in front of the house. The Secret Service was sure\\nit had its man, and Scott had a hell of a time convincing them\\notherwise.\\n\\nBoth Scott and Ed swore up and down that they weren't hackers or\\nphreakers, and they certainly weren't Par. But they knew who Par was,\\nand they told the agents his real name. After considerable pressure\\nfrom the Secret Service, Scott and Ed agreed to make statements down\\nat the police station.\\n\\nIn Chicago, more than 2700 kilometres away from the crisis unfolding\\nin northern California, Par and his mother watched his aunt walk down\\nthe aisle in her white gown.\\n\\nPar telephoned home once, to Scott, to say `hi' from the Midwest. The\\ncall came after the raid.\\n\\n`So,' a relaxed Par asked his room-mate, `How are things going at\\nhome?'\\n\\n`Fine,' Scott replied. `Nothing much happening here.'\\n\\nPar looked down at the red bag he was carrying with a momentary\\nexpression of horror. He realised he stood out in the San Jose bus\\nterminal like a peacock among the pigeons ...\\n\\nBlissfully ignorant of the raid which had occurred three days before,\\nPar and his mother had flown into San Jose airport. They had gone to\\nthe bus terminal to pick up a Greyhound home to the Monterey area.\\nWhile waiting for the bus, Par called his friend Tammi to say he was\\nback in California.\\n\\nAny casual bystander waiting to use the pay phones at that moment\\nwould have seen a remarkable transformation in the brown-haired boy at\\nthe row of phones. The smiling face suddenly dropped in a spasm of\\nshock. His skin turned ash white as the blood fled south. His deep-set\\nchocolate brown eyes, with their long, graceful lashes curving upward\\nand their soft, shy expression, seemed impossibly large.\\n\\nFor at that moment Tammi told Par that his house had been raided by\\nthe Secret Service. That Scott and Ed had been pretty upset about\\nhaving guns shoved in their faces, and had made statements about him\\nto the police. That they thought their phone was tapped. That the\\nSecret Service guys were still hunting for Par, they knew his real\\nname, and she thought there was an all points bulletin out for him.\\nScott had told the Secret Service about Par's red bag, the one with\\nall his hacking notes that he always carried around. The one with the\\nprint-out of all the Citibank credit card numbers.\\n\\nAnd so it was that Par came to gaze down at his bag with a look of\\nalarm. He realised instantly that the Secret Service would be looking\\nfor that red bag. If they didn't know what he looked like, they would\\nsimply watch for the bag.\\n\\nThat bag was not something Par could hide easily. The Citibank\\nprint-out was the size of a phone book. He also had dozens of disks\\nloaded with the cards and other sensitive hacking information.\\n\\nPar had used the cards to make a few free calls, but he hadn't been\\ncharging up any jet skis. He fought temptation valiantly, and in the\\nend he had won, but others might not have been so victorious in the\\nsame battle. Par figured that some less scrupulous hackers had\\nprobably been charging up a storm. He was right. Someone had, for\\nexample, tried to send a $367 bouquet of flowers to a woman in El Paso\\nusing one of the stolen cards. The carder had unwittingly chosen a\\ndebit card belonging to a senior Saudi bank executive who happened to\\nbe in his office at the time the flower order was placed. Citibank\\ninvestigator Larry Wallace added notes on that incident to his growing\\nfile.\\n\\nPar figured that Citibank would probably try to pin every single\\nattempt at carding on him. Why not? What kind of credibility would a\\nseventeen-year-old hacker have in denying those sorts of allegations?\\nZero. Par made a snap decision. He sidled up to a trash bin in a dark\\ncorner. Scanning the scene warily, Par casually reached into the red\\nbag, pulled out the thick wad of Citibank card print-outs and stuffed\\nit into the bin. He fluffed a few stray pieces of garbage over the\\ntop.\\n\\nHe worried about the computer disks with all his other valuable\\nhacking information. They represented thousands of hours of work and\\nhe couldn't bring himself to throw it all away. The 10 megabyte\\ntrophy. More than 4000 cards. 130000 different transactions. In the\\nend, he decided to hold on to the disks, regardless of the risk. At\\nleast, without the print-out, he could crumple the bag up a bit and\\nmake it a little less conspicuous. As Par slowly moved away from the\\nbin, he glanced back to check how nondescript the burial site appeared\\nfrom a distance. It looked like a pile of garbage. Trash worth\\nmillions of dollars, headed for the dump.\\n\\nAs he boarded the bus to Salinas with his mother, Par's mind was\\ninstantly flooded with images of a homeless person fishing the\\nprint-out from the bin and asking someone about it. He tried to push\\nthe idea from his head.\\n\\nDuring the bus ride, Par attempted to figure out what he was going to\\ndo. He didn't tell his mother anything. She couldn't even begin to\\ncomprehend his world of computers and networks, let alone his current\\npredicament. Further, Par and his mother had suffered from a somewhat\\nstrained relationship since he ran away from home not long after his\\nseventeenth birthday. He had been kicked out of school for\\nnon-attendance, but had found a job tutoring students in computers at\\nthe local college. Before the trip to Chicago, he had seen her just\\nonce in six months. No, he couldn't turn to her for help.\\n\\nThe bus rolled toward the Salinas station. En route, it travelled down\\nthe street where Par lived. He saw a jogger, a thin black man wearing\\na walkman. What the hell is a jogger doing here, Par thought. No-one\\njogged in the semi-industrial neighbourhood. Par's house was about the\\nonly residence amid all the light-industrial buildings. As soon as the\\njogger was out of sight of the house, he suddenly broke away from his\\npath, turned off to one side and hit the ground. As he lay on his\\nstomach on some grass, facing the house, he seemed to begin talking\\ninto the walkman.\\n\\nSitting watching this on the bus, Par flipped out. They were out to\\nget him, no doubt about it. When the bus finally arrived at the depot\\nand his mother began sorting out their luggage, Par tucked the red bag\\nunder his arm and disappeared. He found a pay phone and called Scott\\nto find out the status of things. Scott handed the phone to Chris,\\nanother friend who lived in the house. Chris had been away at his\\nparents' home during the Thanksgiving raid.\\n\\n`Hold tight and lay low,' Chris told Par.\\n\\n`I'm on my way over to pick you up and take you to a lawyer's office\\nwhere you can get some sort of protection.'\\n\\nA specialist in criminal law, Richard Rosen was born in New York but\\nraised in his later childhood in California. He had a personality\\nwhich reflected the steely stubbornness of a New Yorker, tempered with\\nthe laid-back friendliness of the west coast. Rosen also harboured a\\nstrong anti-authoritarian streak. He represented the local chapter of\\nHell's Angels in the middle-class County of Monterey. He also caused a\\nsplash representing the growing midwifery movement, which promoted\\nhome-births. The doctors of California didn't like him much as a\\nresult.\\n\\nPar's room-mates met with Rosen after the raid to set things up for\\nPar's return. They told him about the terrifying ordeal of the Secret\\nService raid, and how they were interrogated for an hour and a half\\nbefore being pressured to give statements. Scott, in particular, felt\\nthat he had been forced to give a statement against Par under duress.\\n\\nWhile Par talked to Chris on the phone, he noticed a man standing at\\nthe end of the row of pay phones. This man was also wearing a walkman.\\nHe didn't look Par in the eye. Instead, he faced the wall, glancing\\nfurtively off to the side toward where Par was standing. Who was that\\nguy? Fear welled up inside Par and all sorts of doubts flooded his\\nmind. Who could he trust?\\n\\nScott hadn't told him about the raid. Were his room-mates in cahoots\\nthe Secret Service? Were they just buying time so they could turn him\\nin? There was no-one else Par could turn to. His mother wouldn't\\nunderstand. Besides, she had problems of her own. And he didn't have a\\nfather. As far as Par was concerned, his father was as good as dead.\\nHe had never met the man, but he heard he was a prison officer in\\nFlorida. Not a likely candidate for helping Par in this situation. He\\nwas close to his grandparents--they had bought his computer for him as\\na present--but they lived in a tiny Mid-Western town and they simply\\nwouldn't understand either.\\n\\nPar didn't know what to do, but he didn't seem to have many options at\\nthe moment, so he told Chris he would wait at the station for him.\\nThen he ducked around a corner and tried to hide.\\n\\nA few minutes later, Chris pulled into the depot. Par dove into the\\nToyota Landcruiser and Chris tore out of the station toward Rosen's\\noffice. They noticed a white car race out of the bus station after\\nthem.\\n\\nWhile they drove, Par pieced together the story from Chris. No-one had\\nwarned him about the raid because everyone in the house believed the\\nphone line was tapped. Telling Par while he was in Chicago might have\\nmeant another visit from the Secret Service. All they had been able to\\ndo was line up Rosen to help him.\\n\\nPar checked the rear-view mirror. The white car was still following\\nthem. Chris made a hard turn at the next intersection and accelerated\\ndown the California speedway. The white car tore around the corner in\\npursuit. No matter what Chris did, he couldn't shake the tail. Par sat\\nin the seat next to Chris, quietly freaking out.\\n\\nJust 24 hours before, he had been safe and sound in Chicago. How did\\nhe end up back here in California being chased by a mysterious driver\\nin a white car?\\n\\nChris tried his best to break free, swerving and racing. The white car\\nwouldn't budge. But Chris and Par had one advantage over the white\\ncar; they were in a four-wheel drive. In a split-second decision,\\nChris jerked the steering wheel to one side. The Landcruiser veered\\noff the road onto a lettuce field. Par gripped the inside of the door\\nas the 4WD bounced through the dirt over the neat crop rows. Near-ripe\\nheads of lettuce went flying out from under the tires. Half-shredded\\nlettuce leaves filled the air. A cloud of dirt enveloped the car. The\\nvehicle skidded and jerked, but finally made its way to a highway at\\nthe far end of the field. Chris hit the highway running, swerving into\\nthe lane at high speed.\\n\\nWhen Par looked back, the white car had disappeared. Chris kept his\\nfoot on the accelerator and Par barely breathed until the Landcruiser\\npulled up in front of Richard Rosen's building.\\n\\nPar leaped out, the red bag still clutched tightly under his arm, and\\nhigh-tailed it into the lawyer's office. The receptionist looked a bit\\nshocked when he said his name. Someone must have filled her in on the\\ndetails.\\n\\nRosen quickly ushered him into his office. Introductions were brief\\nand Par cut to the story of the chase. Rosen listened intently,\\noccasionally asking a well-pointed question, and then took control of\\nthe situation.\\n\\nThe first thing they needed to do was call off the Secret Service\\nchase, Rosen said, so Par didn't have to spend any more time ducking\\naround corners and hiding in bus depots. He called the Secret\\nService's San Francisco office and asked Special Agent Thomas J.\\nHolman to kill the Secret Service pursuit in exchange for an agreement\\nthat Par would turn himself in to be formally charged.\\n\\nHolman insisted that they had to talk to Par.\\n\\nNo, Rosen said. There would be no interviews for Par by law\\nenforcement agents until a deal had been worked out.\\n\\nBut the Secret Service needed to talk to Par, Holman insisted. They\\ncould only discuss all the other matters after the Secret Service had\\nhad a chance to talk with Par.\\n\\nRosen politely warned Holman not to attempt to contact his client. You\\nhave something to say to Par, you go through me, he said. Holman did\\nnot like that at all. When the Secret Service wanted to talk to\\nsomeone, they were used to getting their way. He pushed Rosen, but the\\nanswer was still no. No no no and no again. Holman had made a mistake.\\nHe had assumed that everyone wanted to do business with the United\\nStates Secret Service.\\n\\nWhen he finally realised Rosen wouldn't budge, Holman gave up. Rosen\\nthen negotiated with the federal prosecutor, US Attorney Joe Burton,\\nwho was effectively Holman's boss in the case, to call off the pursuit\\nin exchange for Par handing himself in to be formally charged.\\n\\nThen Par gave Rosen his red bag, for safekeeping.\\n\\nAt about the same time, Citibank investigator Wallace and Detective\\nPorter of the Salinas Police interviewed Par's mother as she returned\\nhome from the bus depot. She said that her son had moved out of her\\nhome some six months before, leaving her with a $2000 phone bill she\\ncouldn't pay. They asked if they could search her home. Privately, she\\nworried about what would happen if she refused. Would they tell the\\noffice where she worked as a clerk? Could they get her fired? A simple\\nwoman who had little experience dealing with law enforcement agents,\\nPar's mother agreed. The investigators took Par's disks and papers.\\n\\nPar turned himself in to the Salinas Police in the early afternoon of\\n12 December. The police photographed and fingerprinted him before\\nhanding him a citation--a small yellow slip headed `502 (c) (1) PC'.\\nIt looked like a traffic ticket, but the two charges Par faced were\\nfelonies, and each carried a maximum term of three years for a minor.\\nCount 1, for hacking into Citicorp Credit Services, also carried a\\nfine of up to $10000. Count 2, for `defrauding a telephone service',\\nhad no fine: the charges were for a continuing course of conduct,\\nmeaning that they applied to the same activity over an extended period\\nof time.\\n\\nFederal investigators had been astonished to find Par was so young.\\nDealing with a minor in the federal court system was a big hassle, so\\nthe prosecutor decided to ask the state authorities to prosecute the\\ncase. Par was ordered to appear in Monterey County Juvenile Court on\\n10 July 1989.\\n\\nOver the next few months, Par worked closely with Rosen. Though Rosen\\nwas a very adept lawyer, the situation looked pretty depressing.\\nCitibank claimed it had spent $30000 on securing its systems and Par\\nbelieved that the corporation might be looking for up to $3 million in\\ntotal damages. While they couldn't prove Par had made any money from\\nthe cards himself, the prosecution would argue that his generous\\ndistribution of them had led to serious financial losses. And that was\\njust the financial institutions.\\n\\nMuch more worrying was what might come out about Par's visits to TRW's\\ncomputers. The Secret Service had seized at least one disk with TRW\\nmaterial on it.\\n\\nTRW was a large, diverse company, with assets of $2.1 billion and\\nsales of almost $7 billion in 1989, nearly half of which came from the\\nUS government. It employed more than 73000 people, many of who worked\\nwith the company's credit ratings business. TRW's vast databases held\\nprivate details of millions of people--addresses, phone numbers,\\nfinancial data.\\n\\nThat, however, was just one of the company's many businesses. TRW also\\ndid defence work--very secret defence work. Its Space and Defense\\ndivision, based in Redondo Beach, California, was widely believed to\\nbe a major beneficiary of the Reagan Government's Star Wars budget.\\nMore than 10 per cent of the company's employees worked in this\\ndivision, designing spacecraft systems, communications systems,\\nsatellites and other, unspecified, space `instruments'.\\n\\nThe siezed disk had some mail from the company's TRWMAIL systems. It\\nwasn't particularly sensitive, mostly just company propaganda sent to\\nemployees, but the Secret Service might think that where there was\\nsmoke, there was bound to be fire. TRW did the kind of work that makes\\ngovernments very nervous when it comes to unauthorised access. And Par\\nhad visited certain TRW machines; he knew that company had a missiles\\nresearch section, and even a space weapons section.\\n\\nWith so many people out to get him--Citibank, the Secret Service, the\\nlocal police, even his own mother had helped the other side--it was\\nonly a matter of time before they unearthed the really secret things\\nhe had seen while hacking. Par began to wonder if was such a good idea\\nfor him to stay around for the trial.\\n\\n\\nIn early 1989, when Theorem stepped off the plane which carried her\\nfrom Switzerland to San Francisco, she was pleased that she had\\nmanaged to keep a promise to herself. It wasn't always an easy\\npromise. There were times of intimacy, of perfect connection, between\\nthe two voices on opposite sides of the globe, when it seemed so\\nbreakable.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Par braced himself. Theorem had described herself in such\\ndisparaging terms. He had even heard from others on Altos that she was\\nhomely. But that description had ultimately come from her anyway, so\\nit didn't really count.\\n\\nFinally, as he watched the stream of passengers snake out to the\\nwaiting area, he told himself it didn't matter anyway. After all, he\\nhad fallen in love with her--her being, her essence--not her image as\\nit appeared in flesh. And he had told her so. She had said the same\\nback to him.\\n\\nSuddenly she was there, in front of him. Par had to look up slightly\\nto reach her eyes, since she was a little more than an inch taller.\\nShe was quite pretty, with straight, brown shoulder-length hair and\\nbrown eyes. He was just thinking how much more attractive she was than\\nhe had expected, when it happened.\\n\\nTheorem smiled.\\n\\nPar almost lost his balance. It was a devastating smile, big and\\ntoothy, warm and genuine. Her whole face lit up with a fire of\\nanimation. That smile sealed it.\\n\\nShe had kept her promise to herself. There was no clear image of Par\\nin her mind before meeting him in person. After meeting a few people\\nfrom Altos at a party in Munich the year before, she had tried not to\\ncreate images of people based on their on-line personalities. That way\\nshe would never suffer disappointment.\\n\\nPar and Theorem picked up her bags and got into Brian's car. Brian, a\\nfriend who offered to play airport taxi because Par didn't have a car,\\nthought Theorem was pretty cool. A six-foot-tall French-speaking Swiss\\nwoman. It was definitely cool. They drove back to Par's house. Then\\nBrian came in for a chat.\\n\\nBrian asked Theorem all sorts of questions. He was really curious,\\nbecause he had never met anyone from Europe before. Par kept trying to\\nencourage his friend to leave but Brian wanted to know all about life\\nin Switzerland. What was the weather like? Did people ski all the\\ntime?\\n\\nPar kept looking Brian in the eye and then staring hard at the door.\\n\\nDid most Swiss speak English? What other languages did she know? A lot\\nof people skied in California. It was so cool talking to someone from\\nhalfway around the world.\\n\\nPar did the silent chin-nudge toward the door and, at last, Brian got\\nthe hint. Par ushered his friend out of the house. Brian was only\\nthere for about ten minutes, but it felt like a year. When Par and\\nTheorem were alone, they talked a bit, then Par suggested they go for\\na walk.\\n\\nHalfway down the block, Par tentatively reached for her hand and took\\nit in his own. She seemed to like it. Her hand was warm. They talked a\\nbit more, then Par stopped. He turned to face her. He paused, and then\\ntold her something he had told her before over the telephone,\\nsomething they both knew already.\\n\\nTheorem kissed him. It startled Par. He was completely unprepared.\\nThen Theorem said the same words back to him.\\n\\nWhen they returned to the house, things progressed from there. They\\nspent two and a half weeks in each other's arms--and they were\\nglorious, sun-drenched weeks. The relationship proved to be far, far\\nbetter in person than it had ever been on-line or on the telephone.\\nTheorem had captivated Par, and Par, in turn, created a state of bliss\\nin Theorem.\\n\\nPar showed her around his little world in northern California. They\\nvisited a few tourist sites, but mostly they just spent a lot of time\\nat home. They talked, day and night, about everything.\\n\\nThen it was time for Theorem to leave, to return to her job and her\\nlife in Switzerland. Her departure was hard--driving to the airport,\\nseeing her board the plane--it was heart-wrenching. Theorem looked\\nvery upset. Par just managed to hold it together until the plane took\\noff.\\n\\nFor two and a half weeks, Theorem had blotted out Par's approaching\\ncourt case. As she flew away, the dark reality of the case descended\\non him.\\n\\n\\nThe fish liked to watch.\\n\\nPar sat at the borrowed computer all night in the dark, with only the\\ndull glow of his monitor lighting the room, and the fish would all\\nswim over to the side of their tank and peer out at him. When things\\nwere quiet on-line, Par's attention wandered to the eel and the lion\\nfish. Maybe they were attracted to the phosphorescence of the computer\\nscreen. Whatever the reason, they certainly liked to hover there. It\\nwas eerie.\\n\\nPar took a few more drags of his joint, watched the fish some more,\\ndrank his Coke and then turned his attention back to his computer.\\n\\nThat night, Par saw something he shouldn't have. Not the usual hacker\\nstuff. Not the inside of a university. Not even the inside of an\\ninternational bank containing private financial information about\\nMiddle Eastern sheiks.\\n\\nWhat he saw was information about some sort of killer spy\\nsatellite--those are the words Par used to describe it to other\\nhackers. He said the satellite was capable of shooting down other\\nsatellites caught spying, and he saw it inside a machine connected to\\nTRW's Space and Defense division network. He stumbled upon it much the\\nsame way Force had accidentally found the CitiSaudi machine--through\\nscanning. Par didn't say much else about it because the discovery\\nscared the hell out of him.\\n\\nSuddenly, he felt like the man who knew too much. He'd been in and out\\nof so many military systems, seen so much sensitive material, that he\\nhad become a little blasÃ© about the whole thing. The information was\\ncool to read but, God knows, he never intended to actually do anything\\nwith it. It was just a prize, a glittering trophy testifying to his\\nprowess as a hacker. But this discovery shook him up, slapped him in\\nthe face, made him realise he was exposed.\\n\\nWhat would the Secret Service do to him when they found out? Hand him\\nanother little traffic ticket titled `502C'? No way. Let him tell the\\njury at his trial everything he knew? Let the newspapers print it? Not\\na snowball's chance in hell.\\n\\nThis was the era of Ronald Reagan and George Bush, of space defence\\ninitiatives, of huge defence budgets and very paranoid military\\ncommanders who viewed the world as one giant battlefield with the evil\\nempire of the Soviet Union.\\n\\nWould the US government just lock him up and throw away the key? Would\\nit want to risk him talking to other prisoners--hardened criminals who\\nknew how to make a dollar from that sort of information? Definitely\\nnot.\\n\\nThat left just one option. Elimination.\\n\\nIt was not a pretty thought. But to the seventeen-year-old hacker it\\nwas a very plausible one. Par considered what he could do and came up\\nwith what seemed to be the only solution.\\n\\nRun.\\n\\n                   \",\n",
       " \" 4 -- The Fugitive.\\n\\n\\nThere's one gun, probably more; and the others are pointing at our backdoor.\\n\\n-- from `Knife's Edge', Bird Noises.\\n\\nWhen Par failed to show up for his hearing on 10 July 1989 in the\\nMonterey County Juvenile Court in Salinas, he officially became a\\nfugitive. He had, in fact, already been on the run for some weeks. But\\nno-one knew. Not even his lawyer.\\n\\nRichard Rosen had an idea something was wrong when Par didn't show up\\nfor a meeting some ten days before the hearing, but he kept hoping his\\nclient would come good. Rosen had negotiated a deal for Par:\\nreparations plus fifteen days or less in juvenile prison in exchange\\nfor Par's full cooperation with the Secret Service.\\n\\nPar had appeared deeply troubled over the matter for weeks. He didn't\\nseem to mind telling the Feds how he had broken into various\\ncomputers, but that's not what they were really looking for. They\\nwanted him to rat. And to rat on everyone. They knew Par was a kingpin\\nand, as such, he knew all the important players in the underground.\\nThe perfect stooge. But Par couldn't bring himself to narc. Even if he\\ndid spill his guts, there was still the question of what the\\nauthorities would do to him in prison. The question of elimination\\nloomed large in his mind.\\n\\nSo, one morning, Par simply disappeared. He had planned it carefully,\\npacked his bags discreetly and made arrangements with a trusted friend\\noutside the circle which included his room-mates. The friend drove\\naround to pick Par up when the\\nroom-mates were out. They never had an inkling that the now\\neighteen-year-old Par was about to vanish for a very long time.\\n\\nFirst, Par headed to San Diego. Then LA. Then he made his way to New\\nJersey. After that, he disappeared from the radar screen completely.\\n\\nLife on the run was hard. For the first few months, Par carried around\\ntwo prized possessions; an inexpensive laptop computer and photos of\\nTheorem taken during her visit. They were his lifeline to a different\\nworld and he clutched them in his bag as he moved from one city to\\nanother, often staying with his friends from the computer underground.\\nThe loose-knit network of hackers worked a bit like the\\nnineteenth-century American `underground railroad' used by escaped\\nslaves to flee from the South to the safety of the northern states.\\nExcept that, for Par, there was never a safe haven.\\n\\nPar crisscrossed the continent, always on the move. A week in one\\nplace. A few nights in another. Sometimes there were breaks in the\\nelectronic underground railroad, spaces between the place where one\\nline ended and another began. Those breaks were the hardest. They\\nmeant sleeping out in the open, sometimes in the cold, going without\\nfood and being without anyone to talk to.\\n\\nHe continued hacking, with new-found frenzy, because he was\\ninvincible. What were the law enforcement agencies going to do? Come\\nand arrest him? He was already a fugitive and he figured things\\ncouldn't get much worse. He felt as though he would be on the run\\nforever, and as if he had already been on the run for a lifetime,\\nthough it was only a few months.\\n\\nWhen he was staying with people from the computer underground, Par was\\ncareful. But when he was alone in a dingy motel room, or with people\\ncompletely outside that world, he hacked without fear. Blatant,\\nin-your-face feats. Things he knew the Secret Service would see. Even\\nhis illicit voice mailbox had words for his pursuers:\\n\\nYeah, this is Par. And to all those faggots from the Secret Service\\nwho keep calling and hanging up, well, lots of luck. 'Cause, I mean,\\nyou're so f**king stupid, it's not even funny.\\n\\nI mean, if you had to send my s**t to Apple Computers [for analysis],\\nyou must be so stupid, it's pitiful. You also thought I had\\nblue-boxing equipment [for phreaking]. I'm just laughing trying to\\nthink what you thought was a blue box. You are so lame.\\n\\nOh well. And anyone else who needs to leave me a message, go ahead.\\nAnd everyone take it easy and leave me some s**t. Alright. Later.\\n\\nDespite the bravado, paranoia took hold of Par as it never had before.\\nIf he saw a cop across the street, his breath would quicken and he\\nwould turn and walk in the opposite direction. If the cop was heading\\ntoward him, Par crossed the street and turned down the nearest alley.\\nPolice of any type made him very nervous.\\n\\nBy the autumn of 1989, Par had made his way to a small town in North\\nCarolina. He found a place to stop and rest with a friend who used the\\nhandle The Nibbler and whose family owned a motel. A couple of weeks\\nin one place, in one bed, was paradise. It was also free, which meant\\nhe didn't have to borrow money from Theorem, who helped him out while\\nhe was on the run.\\n\\nPar slept in whatever room happened to be available that night, but he\\nspent most of his time in one of the motel chalets Nibbler used in the\\noff-season as a computer room. They spent days hacking from Nibbler's\\ncomputer. The fugitive had been forced to sell off his inexpensive\\nlaptop before arriving in North Carolina.\\n\\nAfter a few weeks at the motel, however, he couldn't shake the feeling\\nthat he was being watched. There were too many strangers coming and\\ngoing. He wondered if the hotel guests waiting in their cars were\\nspying on him, and he soon began jumping at shadows. Perhaps, he\\nthought, the Secret Service had found him after all.\\n\\nPar thought about how he could investigate the matter in more depth.\\n\\nOne of The Atlanta Three hackers, The Prophet, called Nibbler\\noccasionally to exchange hacking information, particularly security\\nbugs in Unix systems. During one of their talks, Prophet told Par\\nabout a new security flaw he'd been experimenting with on a network\\nthat belonged to the phone company.\\n\\nThe Atlanta Three, a Georgia-based wing of The Legion of Doom, spent a\\ngood deal of time weaving their way through BellSouth, the phone\\ncompany covering the south-eastern US. They knew about phone switching\\nstations the way Par knew about Tymnet. The Secret Service had raided\\nthe hackers in July 1989 but had not arrested them yet, so in\\nSeptember The Prophet continued to maintain an interest in his\\nfavourite target.\\n\\nPar thought the flaw in BellSouth's network sounded very cool and\\nbegan playing around in the company's systems. Dial up the company's\\ncomputer network, poke around, look at things. The usual stuff.\\n\\nIt occurred to Par that he could check out the phone company's records\\nof the motel to see if there was anything unusual going on. He typed\\nin the motel's main phone number and the system fed back the motel's\\naddress, name and some detailed technical information, such as the\\nexact cable and pair attached to the phone number. Then he looked up\\nthe phone line of the computer chalet. Things looked odd on that line.\\n\\nThe line which he and Nibbler used for most of their hacking showed a\\nspecial status: `maintenance unit on line'.\\n\\nWhat maintenance unit? Nibbler hadn't mentioned any problems with any\\nof the motel's lines, but Par checked with him. No problems with the\\ntelephones.\\n\\nPar felt nervous. In addition to messing around with the phone\\ncompany's networks, he had been hacking into a Russian computer\\nnetwork from the computer chalet. The Soviet network was a shiny new\\ntoy. It had only been connected to the rest of the world's global\\npacket-switched network for about a month, which made it particularly\\nattractive virgin territory.\\n\\nNibbler called in a friend to check the motel's phones. The friend, a\\nformer telephone company technician turned freelancer, came over to\\nlook at the equipment. He told Nibbler and Par that something weird\\nwas happening in the motel's phone system. The line voltages were way\\noff.\\n\\nPar realised instantly what was going on. The system was being\\nmonitored. Every line coming in and going out was probably being\\ntapped, which meant only one thing. Someone--the phone company, the\\nlocal police, the FBI or the Secret Service--was onto him.\\n\\nNibbler and Par quickly packed up all Nibbler's computer gear, along\\nwith Par's hacking notes, and moved to another motel across town. They\\nhad to shut down all their hacking activities and cover their tracks.\\n\\nPar had left programs running which sniffed people's passwords and\\nlogin names on a continual basis as they logged in, then dumped all\\nthe information into a file on the hacked machine. He checked that\\nfile every day or so. If he didn't shut the programs down, the log\\nfile would grow until it was so big the system administrator would\\nbecome curious and have a look. When he discovered that his system had\\nbeen hacked he would close the security holes. Par would have problems\\ngetting back into that system.\\n\\nAfter they finished tidying up the hacked systems, they gathered up\\nall Par's notes and Nibbler's computer equipment once again and\\nstashed them in a rented storage space. Then they drove back to the\\nmotel.\\n\\nPar couldn't afford to move on just yet. Besides, maybe only the\\ntelephone company had taken an interest in the motel's phone system.\\nPar had done a lot of poking and prodding of the telecommunications\\ncompanies' computer systems from the motel phone, but he had done it\\nanonymously. Perhaps BellSouth felt a little curious and just wanted\\nto sniff about for more information. If that was the case, the law\\nenforcement agencies probably didn't know that Par, the fugitive, was\\nhiding in the motel.\\n\\nThe atmosphere was becoming oppressive in the motel. Par became even\\nmore watchful of the people coming and going. He glanced out the front\\nwindow a little more often, and he listened a little more carefully to\\nthe footsteps coming and going. How many of the guests were really\\njust tourists? Par went through the guest list and found a man\\nregistered as being from New Jersey. He was from one of the AT&T\\ncorporations left after the break-up of Bell Systems. Why on earth\\nwould an AT&T guy be staying in a tiny hick town in North Carolina?\\nMaybe a few Secret Service agents had snuck into the motel and were\\nwatching the chalet.\\n\\nPar needed to bring the paranoia under control. He needed some fresh\\nair, so he went out for a walk. The weather was bad and the wind blew\\nhard, whipping up small tornadoes of autumn leaves. Soon it began\\nraining and Par sought cover in the pay phone across the street.\\n\\nDespite having been on the run for a few months, Par still called\\nTheorem almost every day, mostly by phreaking calls through bulk\\ntelecommunications companies. He dialled her number and they talked\\nfor a bit. He told her about how the voltage was way off on the\\nmotel's PABX and how the phone might be tapped. She asked how he was\\nholding up. Then they spoke softly about when they might see each\\nother again.\\n\\nOutside the phone box, the storm worsened. The rain hammered the roof\\nfrom one side and then another as the wind jammed it in at strange\\nangles. The darkened street was deserted. Tree branches creaked under\\nthe strain of the wind. Rivulets rushed down the leeward side of the\\nbooth and formed a wall of water outside the glass. Then a trash bin\\ntoppled over and its contents flew onto the road.\\n\\nTrying to ignore to the havoc around him, Par curled the phone handset\\ninto a small protected space, cupped between his hand, his chest and a\\ncorner of the phone booth. He reminded Theorem of their time together\\nin California, of two and a half weeks, and they laughed gently over\\nintimate secrets.\\n\\nA tree branch groaned and then broke under the force of the wind. When\\nit crashed on the pavement near the phone booth, Theorem asked Par\\nwhat the noise was.\\n\\n`There's a hurricane coming,' he told her. `Hurricane Hugo. It was\\nsupposed to hit tonight. I guess it's arrived.'\\n\\nTheorem sounded horrified and insisted Par go back to the safety of\\nthe motel immediately.\\n\\nWhen Par opened the booth door, he was deluged by water. He dashed\\nacross the road, fighting the wind of the hurricane, staggered into his\\nmotel room and jumped into bed to warm up. He fell asleep listening to\\nthe storm, and he dreamed of Theorem.\\n\\nHurricane Hugo lasted more than three days, but they felt like the\\nsafest three days Par had spent in weeks. It was a good bet that the\\nSecret Service wouldn't be conducting any raids during a hurricane.\\nSouth Carolina took the brunt of Hugo but North Carolina also suffered\\nmassive damage. It was one of the worst hurricanes to hit the area in\\ndecades. Winds near its centre reached more than 240 kilometres per\\nhour, causing 60 deaths and $7 billion in damages as it made its way\\nup the coast from the West Indies to the Carolinas.\\n\\nWhen Par stepped outside his motel room one afternoon a few days after\\nthe storm, the air was fresh and clean. He walked to the railing\\noutside his second-storey perch and found himself looking down on a\\nhive of activity in the car park. There were cars. There was a van.\\nThere was a collection of spectators.\\n\\nAnd there was the Secret Service.\\n\\nAt least eight agents wearing blue jackets with the Secret Service\\nemblem on the back.\\n\\nPar froze. He stopped breathing. Everything began to move in slow\\nmotion. A few of the agents formed a circle around one of the guys\\nfrom the motel, a maintenance worker named John, who looked vaguely\\nlike Par. They seemed to be hauling John over the coals, searching his\\nwallet for identification and quizzing him. Then they escorted him to\\nthe van, presumably to run his prints.\\n\\nPar's mind began moving again. He tried to think clearly. What was the\\nbest way out? He had to get back into his room. It would give him some\\ncover while he figured out what to do next. The photos of Theorem\\nflashed through his mind. No way was he going to let the Secret\\nService get hold of those. He needed to stash them and fast.\\n\\nHe could see the Secret Service agents searching the computer chalet.\\nThank God he and Nibbler had moved all the equipment. At least there\\nwas nothing incriminating in there and they wouldn't be able to seize\\nall their gear.\\n\\nPar breathed deeply, deliberately, and forced himself to back away\\nfrom the railing toward the door to his room. He resisted the urge to\\ndash into his room, to recoil from the scene being played out below\\nhim. Abrupt movements would draw the agents' attention.\\n\\nJust as Par began to move, one of the agents turned around. He scanned\\nthe two-storey motel complex and his gaze quickly came to rest on Par.\\nHe looked Par dead in the eye.\\n\\nThis is it, Par thought. I'm screwed. No way out of here now. Months\\non the run only to get done in a hick town in North Carolina. These\\nguys are gonna haul my ass away for good. I'll never see the light of\\nday again. Elimination is the only option.\\n\\nWhile these thoughts raced through Par's mind, he stood rigid, his\\nfeet glued to the cement floor, his face locked into the probing gaze\\nof the Secret Service agent. He felt like they were the only two\\npeople who existed in the universe.\\n\\nThen, inexplicably, the agent looked away. He swivelled around to\\nfinish his conversation with another agent. It was as if he had never\\neven seen the fugitive.\\n\\nPar stood, suspended and unbelieving. Somehow it seemed impossible. He\\nbegan to edge the rest of the way to his motel room. Slowly, casually,\\nhe slid inside and shut the door behind him.\\n\\nHis mind raced back to the photos of Theorem and he searched the room\\nfor a safe hiding place. There wasn't one. The best option was\\nsomething above eye-level. He pulled a chair across the room, climbed\\non it and pressed on the ceiling. The rectangular panel of\\nplasterboard lifted easily and Par slipped the photos in the space,\\nthen replaced the panel. If the agents tore the room apart, they would\\nlikely find the pictures. But the photos would probably escape a quick\\nsearch, which was the best he could hope for at this stage.\\n\\nNext, he turned his mind to escaping. The locals were pretty cool\\nabout everything, and Par thought he could count on the staff not to\\nmention his presence to the Secret Service. That bought him some time,\\nbut he couldn't get out of the room without being seen. Besides, if he\\nwas spotted walking off the property, he would certainly be stopped\\nand questioned.\\n\\nEven if he did manage to get out of the motel grounds, it wouldn't\\nhelp much. The town wasn't big enough to shield him from a thorough\\nsearch and there was no-one there he trusted enough to hide him. It\\nmight look a little suspicious, this young man running away from the\\nmotel on foot in a part of the world where everyone travelled by car.\\nHitchhiking was out of the question. With his luck, he'd probably get\\npicked up by one of the agents leaving the raid. No, he wanted a more\\nviable plan. What he really needed was to get out of the area\\naltogether, to flee the state.\\n\\nPar knew that John travelled to Asheville to attend classes and that\\nhe left very early. If the authorities had been watching the motel for\\na while, they would know that his 5 a.m. departure was normal. And\\nthere was one other thing about the early departure which seemed\\npromising. It was still dark at that hour.\\n\\nIf Par could get as far as Asheville, he might be able to get a lift\\nto Charlotte, and from there he could fly somewhere far away.\\n\\nPar considered the options again and again. Hiding out in the motel\\nroom seemed the most sensible thing to do. He had been moving rooms\\naround the motel pretty regularly, so he might have appeared to be\\njust another traveller to anyone watching the motel. With any luck the\\nSecret Service would be concentrating their search on the chalet,\\nripping the place apart in a vain hunt for the computer equipment. As\\nthese thoughts went through his head, the phone rang, making Par jump.\\nHe stared at it, wondering whether to answer.\\n\\nHe picked it up.\\n\\n`It's Nibbler,' a voice whispered.\\n\\n`Yeah,' Par whispered back.\\n\\n`Par, the Secret Service is here, searching the motel.'\\n\\n`I know. I saw them.'\\n\\n`They've already searched the room next to yours.' Par nearly died.\\nThe agents had been less than two metres from where he was standing\\nand he hadn't even known it. That room was where John stayed. It was\\nconnected to his by an inner door, but both sides were locked.\\n\\n`Move into John's room and lay low. Gotta go.' Nibbler hung up\\nabruptly.\\n\\nPar put his ear to the wall and listened. Nothing. He unlocked the\\nconnecting inner door, turned the knob and pressed lightly. It gave.\\nSomeone had unlocked the other side after the search. Par squinted\\nthrough the crack in the door. The room was silent and still. He\\nopened it--no-one home. Scooping up his things, he quickly moved into\\nJohn's room.\\n\\nThen he waited. Pacing and fidgeting, he strained his ears to catch\\nthe sounds outside. Every bang and creak of a door opening and closing\\nset him on edge. Late that night, after the law enforcement officials\\nhad left, Nibbler called him on the house phone and told him what had\\nhappened.\\n\\nNibbler had been inside the computer chalet when the Secret Service\\nshowed up with a search warrant. The agents took names, numbers, every\\ndetail they could, but they had trouble finding any evidence of\\nhacking. Finally, one of them emerged from the chalet triumphantly\\nwaving a single computer disk in the air. The law enforcement\\nentourage hanging around in front of the chalet let out a little\\ncheer, but Nibbler could hardly keep a straight face. His younger\\nbrother had been learning the basics of computer graphics with a\\nprogram called Logo. The United States Secret Service would soon be\\nuncovering the secret drawings of a primary school student.\\n\\nPar laughed. It helped relieve the stress. Then he told Nibbler his\\nescape plan, and Nibbler agreed to arrange matters. His parents didn't\\nknow the whole story, but they liked Par and wanted to help him. Then\\nNibbler wished his friend well.\\n\\nPar didn't even try to rest before his big escape. He was as highly\\nstrung as a racehorse at the gate. What if the Secret Service was\\nstill watching the place? There was no garage attached to the main\\nmotel building which he could access from the inside. He would be\\nexposed, even though it would only be for a minute or so. The night\\nwould provide reasonable cover, but the escape plan wasn't fool-proof.\\nIf agents were keeping the motel under observation from a distance\\nthey might miss him taking off from his room. On the other hand, there\\ncould be undercover agents posing as guests watching the entire\\ncomplex from inside their room.\\n\\nParanoid thoughts stewed in Par's mind throughout the night. Just\\nbefore 5 a.m., he heard John's car pull up outside. Par flicked off\\nthe light in his room, opened his door a crack and scanned the motel\\ngrounds. All quiet, bar the single car, which puffed and grunted in\\nthe still, cold air. The windows in most of the buildings were dark.\\nIt was now or never.\\n\\nPar opened the door all the way and slipped down the hallway. As he\\ncrept downstairs, the pre-dawn chill sent a shiver down his spine.\\nGlancing quickly from side to side, he hurried toward the waiting car,\\npulled the back door open and dove onto the seat. Keeping his head\\ndown, he twisted around, rolled onto the floor and closed the door\\nwith little more than a soft click.\\n\\nAs the car began to move. Par reached for a blanket which had been\\ntossed on the floor and pulled it over himself. After a while, when\\nJohn told him they were safely out of the town, Par slipped the\\nblanket off his face and he looked up at the early morning sky. He\\ntried to get comfortable on the floor. It was going to be a long ride.\\n\\nAt Asheville, John dropped Par off at an agreed location. Par thanked\\nhim and hopped into a waiting car. Someone else from his extensive\\nnetwork of friends and acquaintances took him to Charlotte.\\n\\nThis time Par rode in the front passenger seat. For the first time, he\\nsaw the true extent of the damage wreaked by Hurricane Hugo. The small\\ntown where he had been staying had been slashed by rain and high\\nwinds, but on the way to the Charlotte airport, where he would pick up\\na flight to New York, Par watched the devastation with amazement. He\\nstared out the car window, unable to take his eyes off the storm's\\ntrail of havoc.\\n\\nThe hurricane had swept up anything loose or fragile and turned it\\ninto a missile on a suicide mission. Whatever mangled, broken\\nfragments remained after the turbulent winds had passed would have\\nbeen almost unrecognisable to those who had seen them before.\\n\\n\\nTheorem worried about Par as he staggered from corner to corner of the\\ncontinent. In fact, she had often asked him to consider giving himself\\nup. Moving from town to town was taking its toll on Par, and it wasn't\\nthat much easier on Theorem. She hadn't thought going on the lam was\\nsuch a great idea in the first place, and she offered to pay for his\\nlawyer so he could stop running. Par declined. How could he hand\\nhimself in when he believed elimination was a real possibility?\\nTheorem sent him money, since he had no way of earning a living and he\\nneeded to eat. The worst parts, though, were the dark thoughts that\\nkept crossing her mind. Anything could happen to Par between phone\\ncalls. Was he alive? In prison? Had he been raided, even accidentally\\nshot during a raid?\\n\\nThe Secret Service and the private security people seemed to want him\\nso badly. It was worrying, but hardly surprising. Par had embarrassed\\nthem. He had broken into their machines and passed their private\\ninformation around in the underground. They had raided his home when\\nhe wasn't even home. Then he had escaped a second raid, in North\\nCarolina, slipping between their fingers. He was constantly in their\\nface, continuing to hack blatantly and to show them contempt in things\\nsuch as his voicemail message. He figured they were probably\\nexasperated from chasing all sorts of false leads as well, since he\\nwas perpetually spreading fake rumours about his whereabouts. Most of\\nall, he thought they knew what he had seen inside the TRW system. He\\nwas a risk.\\n\\nPar became more and more paranoid, always watching over his shoulder\\nas he moved from city to city. He was always tired. He could never\\nsleep properly, worrying about the knock on the door. Some mornings,\\nafter a fitful few hours of rest, he woke with a start, unable to\\nremember where he was. Which house or motel, which friends, which\\ncity.\\n\\nHe still hacked all the time, borrowing machines where he could. He\\nposted messages frequently on The Phoenix Project, an exclusive BBS\\nrun by The Mentor and Erik Bloodaxe and frequented by LOD members and\\nthe Australian hackers. Some well-known computer security people were\\nalso invited onto certain, limited areas of the Texas-based board,\\nwhich immediately elevated the status of The Phoenix Project in the\\ncomputer underground. Hackers were as curious about the security\\npeople as the security people were about their prey. The Phoenix\\nProject was special because it provided neutral ground, where both\\nsides could meet to exchange ideas.\\n\\nVia the messages, Par continued to improve his hacking skills while\\nalso talking with his friends, people like Erik Bloodaxe, from Texas,\\nand Phoenix, from The Realm in Melbourne. Electron also frequented The\\nPhoenix Project. These hackers knew Par was on the run, and sometimes\\nthey joked with him about it. The humour made the stark reality of\\nPar's situation bearable. All the hackers on The Phoenix Project had\\nconsidered the prospect of being caught. But the presence of Par, and\\nhis tortured existence on the run, hammered the implications home with\\nsome regularity.\\n\\nAs Par's messages became depressed and paranoid, other hackers tried\\nto do what they could to help him. Elite US and foreign hackers who\\nhad access to the private sections of The Phoenix Project saw his\\nmessages and they felt for him. Yet Par continued to slide deeper and\\ndeeper into his own strange world.\\n\\nSubject: DAMN !!!\\nFrom: The Parmaster\\nDate: Sat Jan 13 08:40:17 1990\\n\\ns**t, i got drunk last night and went onto that Philippine system...\\nStupid Admin comes on and asks who i am ...\\n\\nNext thing i know, i'm booted off and both accounts on the system are gone.\\nNot only this .. but the\\nwhole f**king Philippine Net isn't accepting collect calls anymore.

Tell them you've seen them sitting there all\\nday and you thought they were stuck. Ask them if they need a jump.\\n\\n- Aston\\n\\nBetween these strange messages, Par often posted comments on technical\\nmatters. Other hackers routinely asked him questions about X.25\\nnetworks. Unlike some hackers, Par almost always offered some help. In\\nfact, he believed that being `one of the teachers' made him a\\nparticular target. But his willingness to teach others so readily,\\ncombined with his relatively humble, self-effacing demeanour, made Par\\npopular among many hackers. It was one reason he found so many places\\nto stay.\\n\\nSpring arrived, brushing aside a few of the hardships of a winter on\\nthe run, then summer. Par was still on the run, still dodging the\\nSecret Service's national hunt for the fugitive. By autumn, Par had\\neluded law enforcement officials around the United States for more\\nthan a year. The gloom of another cold winter on the run sat on the\\nhorizon of Par's future, but he didn't care. Anything, everything was\\nbearable. He could take anything Fate would dish up because he had\\nsomething to live for.\\n\\nTheorem was coming to visit him again.\\n\\nWhen Theorem arrived in New York in early 1991, the weather was\\nbitterly cold. They travelled to Connecticut, where Par was staying in\\na share-house with friends.\\n\\nPar was nervous about a lot of things, but mostly about whether things\\nwould be the same with Theorem. Within a few hours of her arrival, his\\nfears were assuaged. Theorem felt as passionately about him as she had\\nin California more than twelve months before. His own feelings were\\neven stronger. Theorem was a liferaft of happiness in the growing\\nturmoil of his life.\\n\\nBut things were different in the outside world. Life on the run with\\nTheorem was grim. Constantly dependent on other people, on their\\ncharity, they were also subject to their petty whims.\\n\\nA room-mate in the share-house got very drunk one night and picked a\\nfight with one of Par's friends. It was a major row and the friend\\nstormed out. In a fit of intoxicated fury, the drunk threatened to\\nturn Par in to the authorities. Slurring his angry words, he announced\\nhe was going to call the FBI, CIA and Secret Service to tell them all\\nwhere Par was living.\\n\\nPar and Theorem didn't want to wait around to see if the drunk would\\nbe true to his word. They grabbed their coats and fled into the\\ndarkness. With little money, and no place else to stay, they walked\\naround for hours in the blistering, cold wind. Eventually they decided\\nthey had no choice but to return to the house late at night, hopefully\\nafter the drunk had fallen asleep.\\n\\nThey sidled up to the front of the house, alert and on edge. It was\\nquite possible the drunk had called every law enforcement agency his\\nblurry mind could recall, in which case a collection of agents would\\nbe lying in wait. The street was deadly quiet. All the parked cars\\nwere deserted. Par peered in a darkened window but he couldn't see\\nanything. He motioned for Theorem to follow him into the house.\\n\\nThough she couldn't see Par's face, Theorem could feel his tension.\\nMost of the time, she revelled in their closeness, a proximity which\\nat times seemed to border on telepathy. But at this moment, the\\nextraordinary gift of empathy felt like a curse. Theorem could feel\\nPar's all-consuming paranoia, and it filled her with terror as they\\ncrept through the hall, checking each room. Finally they reached Par's\\nroom, expecting to find two or three Secret Service agents waiting\\npatiently for them in the dark.\\n\\nIt was empty.\\n\\nThey climbed into bed and tried to get some sleep, but Theorem lay\\nawake in the dark for a little while, thinking about the strange and\\nfearful experience of returning to the house. Though she spoke to Par\\non the phone almost every day when they were apart, she realised she\\nhad missed something.\\n\\nBeing on the run for so long had changed Par.\\n\\nSome time after she returned to Switzerland, Theorem's access to Altos\\nshrivelled up and died. She had been logging in through her old\\nuniversity account but the university eventually killed her access\\nsince she was no longer a student. Without access to any X.25 network\\nlinked to the outside world, she couldn't logon to Altos. Although she\\nwas never involved with hacking, Theorem had become quite addicted to\\nAltos. The loss of access to the Swiss X.25 network--and therefore to\\nAltos--left her feeling very depressed. She told Par over the\\ntelephone, in sombre tones.\\n\\nPar decide to make a little present for Theorem. While most hackers\\nbroke into computers hanging off the X.25 networks, Par broke into the\\ncomputers of the companies which ran the X.25 networks. Having control\\nover the machines owned by Telenet or Tymnet was real power. And as the\\nmaster of X.25 networks, Par could simply create a special account--just\\nfor Theorem--on Tymnet.\\n\\nWhen Par finished making the account, he leaned back in his chair\\nfeeling pretty pleased with himself.\\n\\nAccount name: Theorem.\\n\\nPassword: ParLovesMe!\\n\\nWell, thought Par, she's going to have to type that in every time she\\ngets on the Tymnet network. Altos might be filled with the world's\\nbest hackers, and they might even try to flirt with Theorem, but\\nshe'll be thinking of me every time she logs on, he thought.\\n\\nPar called her on the telephone and gave her his special present. When\\nhe told her the password to her new account, Theorem laughed. She\\nthought it was sweet.\\n\\nAnd so did the MOD boys.\\n\\nMasters of Deception, or Destruction--it depended on who told the\\nstory--was a New York-based gang of hackers. They thought it would be\\ncool to hack Altos. It wasn't that easy to get Altos shell access,\\nwhich Theorem had, and most people had to settle for using one of the\\n`guest' accounts. But it was much easier to hack Altos from a shell\\naccount than from a `guest' account. Theorem's account would be the\\ntargeted jump-off point.\\n\\nHow did MOD get Theorem's Altos password? Most probably they were\\nwatching one of the X.25 gateways she used as she passed through\\nTymnet on her way to Altos. Maybe the MOD boys sniffed her password en\\nroute. Or maybe they were watching the Tymnet security officials who\\nwere watching that gateway.\\n\\nIn the end it didn't matter how MOD got Theorem's password on Altos.\\nWhat mattered was that they changed her password. When Theorem\\ncouldn't get into Altos she was beside herself. She felt like a junkie\\ngoing cold turkey. It was too much. And of course she couldn't reach\\nPar. Because he was on the run, she had to wait for him to call her.\\nIn fact she couldn't reach any of her other friends on Altos to ask\\nfor help. How was she going to find them? They were all hackers. They\\nchose handles so no-one would know their real names.\\n\\nWhat Theorem didn't know was that, not only had she lost access to\\nAltos, but the MOD boys were using her account to hack the Altos\\nsystem. To the outside world it appeared as though she was doing it.\\n\\nTheorem finally managed to get a third-hand message to Gandalf, a\\nwell-known British hacker. She sought him out for two reasons. First,\\nhe was a good friend and was therefore likely to help her out. Second,\\nGandalf had root access on Altos, which meant he could give her a new\\npassword or account.\\n\\nGandalf had established quite a reputation for himself in the computer\\nunderground through the hacking group 8lgm--The Eight-Legged Groove\\nMachine, named after a British band. He and his friend, fellow British\\nhacker Pad, had the best four legs in the chorus line. They were a\\nworld-class act, and certainly some of the best talent to come out of\\nthe British hacking scene. But Gandalf and, to a lesser extent, Pad\\nhad also developed a reputation for being arrogant. They rubbed some\\nof the American hackers the wrong way. Not that Pad and Gandalf seemed\\nto care. Their attitude was: We're good. We know it. Bugger off.\\n\\nGandalf disabled Theorem's account on Altos. He couldn't very well\\njust change the password and then send the new one through the\\nextended grapevine that Theorem had used to get a message through to\\nhim. Clearly, someone had targeted her account specifically. No way\\nwas he going to broadcast a new password for her account throughout\\nthe underground. But the trouble was that neither Par nor Theorem knew\\nwhat Gandalf had done.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Par called Theorem and got an earful. An angry Par vowed to\\nfind out just who the hell had been messing with her account.\\n\\nWhen the MOD boys told Par they were the culprits, he was a bit\\nsurprised because he had always been on good terms with them. Par told\\nthem how upset Theorem had been, how she gave him an earful. Then an\\nextraordinary thing happened. Corrupt, the toughest, baddest guy in\\nMOD, the black kid from the roughest part of New York, the hacker who\\ngave s**t to everyone because he could, apologised to Par.\\n\\nThe MOD guys never apologised, even when they knew they were in the\\nwrong. Apologies never got anyone very far on a New York City street.\\nIt was an attitude thing. `I'm sorry, man' from Corrupt was the\\nequivalent of a normal person licking the mud from the soles of your\\nshoes.\\n\\nThe new password was: M0Dm0dM0D. That's the kind of guys they were.\\n\\nPar was just signing off to try out the new password when Corrupt\\njumped in.\\n\\n`Yeah, and ah, Par, there's something you should know.'\\n\\n`Yeah?' Par answered, anxious to go.\\n\\n`I checked out her mail. There was some stuff in it.'\\n\\nTheorem's letters? Stuff? `What kind of stuff?' he asked.\\n\\n`Letters from Gandalf.'\\n\\n`Yeah?'\\n\\n`Friendly letters. Real friendly.'\\n\\nPar wanted to know, but at the same time, he didn't. He could have\\narranged root access on Altos long ago if he'd really wanted it. But\\nhe didn't. He didn't want it because it would mean he could access\\nTheorem's mail. And Par knew that if he could, he would. Theorem was\\npopular on Altos and, being the suspicious type, Par knew he would\\nprobably take something perfectly innocent and read it the wrong way.\\nThen he would get in a fight with Theorem, and their time together was\\ntoo precious for that.\\n\\n`Too friendly,' Corrupt went on. It must have been hard for him to\\ntell Par. Snagging a friend's girlfriend's password and breaking into\\nher account was one thing. There wasn't much wrong with that. But\\nbreaking that kind of news, well, that was harsh. Especially since\\nCorrupt had worked with Gandalf in 8lgm.\\n\\n`Thanks,' Par said finally. Then he took off.\\n\\nWhen Par tried out the MOD password, it didn't work of course, because\\nGandalf had disabled the account. But Par didn't know that. Finding\\nout that Theorem's account was disabled didn't bother him, but\\ndiscovering who disabled it for her didn't make Par all that happy.\\nStill, when he confronted Theorem, she denied that anything was going\\non between her and Gandalf.\\n\\nWhat could Par do? He could believe Theorem or he could doubt her.\\nBelieving her was hard, but doubting her was painful. So he chose to\\nbelieve her.\\n\\nThe incident made Theorem take a long look at Altos. It was doing bad\\nthings to her life. In the days that she was locked out of the German\\nchat system, she had made the unpleasant discovery that she was\\ncompletely addicted. And she didn't like it at all. Staring at her\\nlife with fresh eyes, she realised she had been ignoring her friends\\nand her life in Switzerland. What on earth was she doing, spending\\nevery night in front of a computer screen?\\n\\nSo Theorem made a tough decision.\\n\\nShe decided to stop using Altos forever.\\n\\n\\nBad things seemed to happen to The Parmaster around Thanksgiving.\\n\\nIn late November 1991, Par flew up from Virginia Beach to New York. An\\nacquaintance named Morty Rosenfeld, who hung out with the MOD hackers\\na bit, had invited him to come for a visit. Par thought a trip to the\\nCity would do him good.\\n\\nMorty wasn't exactly Par's best friend, but he was all right. He had\\nbeen charged by the Feds a few months earlier for selling a password\\nto a credit record company which resulted in credit card fraud. Par\\ndidn't go in for selling passwords, but to each his own. Morty wasn't\\ntoo bad in the right dose. He had a place on Coney Island, which was\\nhardly the Village in Manhattan, but close enough, and he had a\\nfold-out sofa bed. It beat sleeping on the floor somewhere else.\\n\\nPar hung out with a Morty and a bunch of his friends, drinking and\\ngoofing around on Morty's computer.\\n\\nOne morning, Par woke up with a vicious hangover. His stomach was\\ngrowling and there was nothing edible in the fridge, so he rang up and\\nordered pork fried rice from a Chinese take-away. Then he threw on\\nsome clothes and sat on the end of the sofa-bed, smoking a cigarette\\nwhile he waited. He didn't start smoking until he was nineteen, some\\ntime late into his second year on the run. It calmed his nerves.\\n\\nThere was a knock at the front door. Par's stomach grumbled in\\nresponse. As he walked toward the front door, he thought Pork Fried\\nRice, here I come. But when Par opened the front door, there was\\nsomething else waiting for him.\\n\\nThe Secret Service.\\n\\nTwo men. An older, distinguished gentleman standing on the left and a\\nyoung guy on the right. The young guy's eyes opened wide when he saw\\nPar.\\n\\nSuddenly, the young guy pushed Par, and kept pushing him. Small, hard,\\nfast thrusts. Par couldn't get his balance. Each time he almost got\\nhis footing, the agent shoved the hacker backward again until he\\nlanded against the wall. The agent spun Par around so his face pressed\\nagainst the wall and pushed a gun into his kidney. Then he slammed\\nhandcuffs on Par and started frisking him for weapons.\\n\\nPar looked at Morty, now sobbing in the corner, and thought, You\\nnarced on me.\\n\\nOnce Par was safely cuffed, the agents flashed their badges to him.\\nThen they took him outside, escorted him into a waiting car and drove\\ninto Manhattan. They pulled up in front of the World Trade Center and\\nwhen Par got out the young agent swapped the cuffs so Par's hands were\\nin front of him.\\n\\nAs the agents escorted the handcuffed fugitive up a large escalator,\\nthe corporate world stared at the trio. Business men and women in prim\\nnavy suits, secretaries and office boys all watched wide-eyed from the\\nopposite escalator. And if the handcuffs weren't bad enough, the\\nyounger Secret Service agent was wearing a nylon jacket with a\\nnoticeable gun-shaped lump in the front pouch.\\n\\nWhy are these guys bringing me in the front entrance? Par kept\\nthinking. Surely there must be a backdoor, a car park back entrance.\\nSomething not quite so public.\\n\\nThe view from any reasonably high floor of the World Trade Center is\\nbreathtaking, but Par never got a chance to enjoy the vista. He was\\nhustled into a windowless room and handcuffed to a chair. The agents\\nmoved in and out, sorting out paperwork details. They uncuffed him\\nbriefly while they inked his fingers and rolled them across sheets of\\npaper. Then they made him give handwriting samples, first his right\\nhand then his left.\\n\\nPar didn't mind being cuffed to the chair so much, but he found the\\ngiant metal cage in the middle of the fingerprinting room deeply\\ndisturbing. It reminded him of an animal cage, the kind used in old\\nzoos.\\n\\nThe two agents who arrested him left the room, but another one came\\nin. And the third agent was far from friendly. He began playing the\\nbad cop, railing at Par, shouting at him, trying to unnerve him. But\\nno amount of yelling from the agent could rile Par as much as the\\nnature of the questions he asked.\\n\\nThe agent didn't ask a single question about Citibank. Instead, he\\ndemanded to hear everything Par knew about TRW.\\n\\nAll Par's worst nightmares about the killer spy satellite, about\\nbecoming the man who knew too much, rushed through his mind.\\n\\nPar refused to answer. He just sat silently, staring at the agent.\\n\\nEventually, the older agent came back into the room, dragged the\\npitbull agent away and took him outside for a whispered chat. After\\nthat, the pitbull agent was all sweetness and light with Par. Not\\nanother word about TRW.\\n\\nPar wondered why a senior guy from the Secret Service would tell his\\nminion to clam up about the defence contractor? What was behind the\\nsudden silence? The abrupt shift alarmed Par almost as much as the\\nquestions had in the first place.\\n\\nThe agent told Par he would be remanded in custody while awaiting\\nextradition to California. After all the paperwork had been completed,\\nthey released him from the handcuffs and let him stand to stretch. Par\\nasked for a cigarette and one of the agents gave him one. Then a\\ncouple of other agents--junior guys--came in.\\n\\nThe junior agents were very friendly. One of them even shook Par's\\nhand and introduced himself. They knew all about the hacker. They knew\\nhis voice from outgoing messages on voicemail boxes he had created for\\nhimself. They knew what he looked like from his California police\\nfile, and maybe even surveillance photos. They knew his personality\\nfrom telephone bridge conversations which had been recorded and from\\nthe details of his Secret Service file. Perhaps they had even tracked\\nhim around the country, following a trail of clues left in his\\nflightpath. Whatever research they had done, one thing was clear.\\nThese agents felt like they knew him intimately--Par the person, not\\njust Par the hacker.\\n\\nIt was a strange sensation. These guys Par had never met before\\nchatted with him about the latest Michael Jackson video as if he was a\\nneighbour or friend just returned from out of town. Then they took him\\nfurther uptown, to a police station, for more extradition paperwork.\\n\\nThis place was no World Trade Center deluxe office. Par stared at the\\npeeling grey paint in the ancient room, and then watched officers\\ntyping out reports using the two-finger hunt-and-peck method on\\nelectric typewriters--not a computer in sight. The officers didn't\\ncuff Par to the desk. Par was in the heart of a police station and\\nthere was no way he was going anywhere.\\n\\nWhile the officer handling Par was away from his desk for ten minutes,\\nPar felt bored. So he began flipping through the folders with\\ninformation on other cases on the officer's desk. They were heavy duty\\nfraud cases--mafia and drug-money laundering--cases which carried\\nreference to FBI involvement. These people looked hairy.\\n\\nThat day, Par had a quick appearance in court, just long enough to be\\ngiven protective custody in the Manhattan detention complex known as\\nthe Tombs while he waited for the authorities from California to come\\nand pick him up.\\n\\nPar spent almost a week in the Tombs. By day three, he was climbing\\nthe walls. It was like being buried alive.\\n\\nDuring that week, Par had almost no contact with other human beings--a\\nterrible punishment for someone with so much need for a continual flow\\nof new information. He never left his cell. His jailer slid trays of\\nfood into his cell and took them away.\\n\\nOn day six, Par went nuts. He threw a fit, began screaming and banging\\non the door. He yelled at the guard. Told him none too nicely that he\\nwanted to `get the f**k outta here'. The guard said he would see if he\\ncould get Par transferred to Rikers Island, New York's notorious jail.\\nPar didn't care if he was transferred to the moon, as long as he got\\nout of solitary confinement.\\n\\nExcept for the serial killer, the north infirmary at Rikers Island was\\na considerable improvement on the Tombs. Par was only locked in his\\ncell at night. During the day he was free to roam inside the infirmary\\narea with other prisoners. Some of them were there because the\\nauthorities didn't want to put them in with the hardened criminals,\\nand some of them were there because they were probably criminally\\ninsane.\\n\\nIt was an eclectic bunch. A fireman turned jewellery heister. A\\nColombian drug lord. A chop-shop ringleader, who collected more than\\n300 stolen cars, chopped them up, reassembled them as new and then\\nsold them off. A man who killed a homosexual for coming onto him.\\n`Faggot Killer', as he was known inside, hadn't meant to kill anyone:\\nthings had gotten a little out of hand; next thing he knew, he was\\nfacing ten to twelve on a murder rap.\\n\\nPar wasn't wild about the idea of hanging out with a murderer, but he\\nwas nervous about what could happened to a young man in jail. Forging\\na friendship with Faggot Killer would send the right message. Besides,\\nthe guy seemed to be OK. Well, as long as you didn't look at him the\\nwrong way.\\n\\nOn his first day, Par also met Kentucky, a wild-eyed man who\\nintroduced himself by thrusting a crumpled newspaper article into the\\nhacker's hand and saying, `That's me'. The article, titled `Voices\\nTold Him to Kill', described how police had apprehended a serial\\nkiller believed to be responsible for a dozen murders, maybe more.\\nDuring his last murder, Kentucky told Par he had killed a woman--and\\nthen written the names of the aliens who had commanded him to do it on\\nthe walls of her apartment in her blood.\\n\\nThe jewellery heister tried to warn Par to stay away from Kentucky,\\nwho continued to liaise with the aliens on a regular basis. But it was\\ntoo late. Kentucky decided that he didn't like the young hacker. He\\nstarted shouting at Par, picking a fight. Par stood there, stunned and\\nconfused. How should he deal with an aggravated serial killer? And\\nwhat the hell was he doing in jail with a serial killer raving at him\\nanyway? It was all too much.\\n\\nThe jewellery heister rushed over to Kentucky and tried to calm him\\ndown, speaking in soothing tones. Kentucky glowered at Par, but he\\nstopped yelling.\\n\\nA few days into his stay at Rikers, Faggot Killer invited Par to join\\nin a game of Dungeons and Dragons. It beat watching TV talk shows all\\nday, so Par agreed. He sat down at the metal picnic table where Faggot\\nKiller had laid out the board.\\n\\nSo it was that Par, the twenty-year-old computer hacker from\\nCalifornia, the X.25 network whiz kid, came to play Dungeons and\\nDragons with a jewellery thief, a homophobic murderer and a mad serial\\nkiller in Rikers Island. Par found himself marvelling at the\\nsurrealism of the situation.\\n\\nKentucky threw himself into the game. He seemed to get off on killing\\nhobgoblins.\\n\\n`I'll take my halberd,' Kentucky began with a smile, `and I stab this\\ngoblin.' The next player began to make his move, but Kentucky\\ninterrupted. `I'm not done,' he said slowly, as a demonic grin spread\\nacross his face. `And I slice it. And cut it. It bleeds everywhere.'\\nKentucky's face tensed with pleasure.\\n\\nThe other three players shifted uncomfortably in their seats. Par\\nlooked at Faggot Killer with nervous eyes.\\n\\n`And I thrust a knife into its heart,' Kentucky continued, the volume\\nof his voice rising with excitement. `Blood, blood, everywhere blood.\\nAnd I take the knife and hack him. And I hack and hack and hack.'\\n\\nKentucky jumped up from the table and began shouting, thrusting one\\narm downward through the air with an imaginary dagger, `And I hack and\\nI hack and I hack!'\\n\\nThen Kentucky went suddenly still. Everyone at the table froze. No-one\\ndared move for fear of driving him over the edge. Par's stomach had\\njumped into his throat. He tried to gauge how many seconds it would\\ntake to extricate himself from the picnic table and make a break for\\nthe far side of the room.\\n\\nIn a daze, Kentucky walked away from the table, leaned his forehead\\nagainst the wall and began mumbling quietly. The jewellery heister\\nslowly followed and spoke to him briefly in hushed tones before\\nreturning to the table.\\n\\nOne of the guards had heard the ruckus and came up to the table.\\n\\n`Is that guy OK?' he asked the jewellery heister while pointing to\\nKentucky.\\n\\nNot even if you used that term loosely, Par thought.\\n\\n`Leave him alone,' the heister told the guard. `He's talking to the\\naliens.'\\n\\n`Right.' The guard turned around and left.\\n\\nEvery day, a nurse brought around special medicine for Kentucky. In\\nfact, Kentucky was zonked out most of the time on a cup of horrible,\\nsmelly liquid. Sometimes, though, Kentucky secreted his medicine away\\nand traded it with another prisoner who wanted to get zonked out for a\\nday or so.\\n\\nThose were bad days, the days when Kentucky had sold his medication.\\nIt was on one of those days that he tried to kill Par.\\n\\nPar sat on a metal bench, talking to other prisoners, when suddenly he\\nfelt an arm wrap around his neck. He tried to turn around, but\\ncouldn't.\\n\\n`Here. I'll show you how I killed this one guy,' Kentucky whispered to\\nPar.\\n\\n`No--No--' Par started to say, but Kentucky's biceps began pressing\\nagainst Par's Adam's apple. It was a vice-like grip.\\n\\n`Yeah. Like this. I did it like this,' Kentucky said as he tensed his\\nmuscle and pulled backward.\\n\\n`No! Really, you don't need to. It's OK,' Par gasped. No air. His arms\\nflailing in front of him.\\n\\nI'm done for, Par thought. My life is over. Hacker Murdered by Serial\\nKiller in Rikers Island. `Aliens Told Me to Do It.'\\n\\nThe omnipresent jewellery heister came up to Kentucky and started\\ncooing in his ear to let Par go. Then, just when Par thought he was\\nabout to pass out, the jewellery heister pulled Kentucky off him.\\n\\nPar reminded himself to always sit with his back against the wall.\\n\\nFinally, after almost a month behind bars, Par was informed that an\\nofficer from the Monterey County sheriff's office was coming to take\\nhim back to California. Par had agreed to be extradited to California\\nafter seeing the inside of New York's jails. Dealing with the federal\\nprosecutor in New York had also helped make up his mind.\\n\\nThe US Attorney's Office in New York gave Richard Rosen, who had taken\\nthe case on again, a real headache. They didn't play ball. They played\\n`Queen for a Day'.\\n\\nThe way they negotiated reminded Rosen of an old American television\\ngame of that name. The show's host pulled some innocent soul off the\\nstreet, seated her on a garish throne, asked her questions and then\\ngave her prizes. The US Attorney's Office in New York wanted to seat\\nPar on a throne, of sorts, to ask him lots of questions. At the end of\\nthe unfettered interrogation, they would hand out prizes. Prison\\nterms. Fines. Convictions. As they saw fit. No guaranteed sentences.\\nThey would decide what leniency, if any, he would get at the end of\\nthe game.\\n\\nPar knew what they were looking for: evidence against the MOD boys. He\\nwasn't having a bar of that. The situation stank, so Par decided not to\\nfight the extradition to California. Anything had to be better than New\\nYork, with its crazy jail inmates and arrogant federal prosecutors.\\n\\nThe officer from the Monterey sheriff's office picked Par up on 17\\nDecember 1991.\\n\\nPar spent the next few weeks in jail in California, but this time he\\nwasn't in any sort of protective custody. He had to share a cell with\\nMexican drug dealers and other mafia, but at least he knew his way\\naround these people. And unlike the some of the people at Rikers, they\\nweren't stark raving lunatics.\\n\\nRichard Rosen took the case back, despite Par's having skipped town\\nthe first time, which Par thought was pretty good of the lawyer. But\\nPar had no idea how good it would be for him until it came to his\\ncourt date.\\n\\nPar called Rosen from the jail, to talk about the case. Rosen had some\\nbig news for him.\\n\\n`Plead guilty. You're going to plead guilty to everything,' he told\\nPar.\\n\\nPar thought Rosen had lost his marbles.\\n\\n`No. We can win this case if you plead guilty,' Rosen assured him.\\n\\nPar sat dumbfounded at the other end of the phone.\\n\\n`Trust me,' the lawyer said.\\n\\nThe meticulous Richard Rosen had found a devastating weapon.\\n\\nOn 23 December 1991, Par pleaded guilty to two charges in Monterey\\nCounty Juvenile Court. He admitted everything. The whole nine yards.\\nYes, I am The Parmaster. Yes, I broke into computers. Yes, I took\\nthousands of credit card details from a Citibank machine. Yes, yes,\\nyes.\\n\\nIn some way, the experience was cathartic, but only because Par knew\\nRosen had a brilliant ace up his sleeve.\\n\\nRosen had rushed the case to be sure it would be heard in juvenile\\ncourt, where Par would get a more lenient sentence. But just because\\nRosen was in a hurry didn't mean he was sloppy. When he went through\\nPar's file with a fine-toothed comb he discovered the official papers\\ndeclared Par's birthday to be 15 January 1971. In fact, Par's birthday\\nwas some days earlier, but the DA's office didn't know that.\\n\\nUnder California law, a juvenile court has jurisdiction over citizens\\nunder the age of 21. You can only be tried and sentenced in a juvenile\\ncourt if you committed the crimes in question while under the age of\\neighteen and you are still under the age of 21 when you plead and are\\nsentenced.\\n\\nPar was due to be sentenced on 13 January but on 8 January Rosen\\napplied for the case to be thrown out. When Deputy DA David Schott\\nasked why, Rosen dropped his bomb.\\n\\nPar had already turned 21 and the juvenile court had no authority to\\npass sentence over him. Further, in California, a case cannot be moved\\ninto an adult court if the defendant has already entered a plea in a\\njuvenile one. Because Par had already done that, his case couldn't be\\nmoved. The matter was considered `dealt with' in the eyes of the law.\\n\\nThe Deputy DA was flabbergasted. He spluttered and spewed. The DA's\\noffice had dropped the original charges from a felony to a\\nmisdemeanour. They had come to the table. How could this happen? Par\\nwas a fugitive. He had been on the run for more than two years from\\nthe frigging Secret Service, for Christ's sake. There was no way--NO\\nWAY--he was going to walk out of that courtroom scot-free.\\n\\nThe court asked Par to prove his birthday. A quick driver's licence\\nsearch at the department of motor vehicles showed Par and his lawyer\\nwere telling the truth. So Par walked free.\\n\\nWhen he stepped outside the courthouse, Par turned his face toward the\\nsun. After almost two months in three different jails on two sides of\\nthe continent, the sun felt magnificent. Walking around felt\\nwonderful. Just wandering down the street made him happy.\\n\\nHowever, Par never really got over being on the run.\\n\\nFrom the time he walked free from the County Jail in Salinas,\\nCalifornia, he continued to move around the country, picking up\\ntemporary work here and there. But he found it hard to settle in one\\nplace. Worst of all, strange things began happening to him. Well, they\\nhad always happened to him, but they were getting stranger by the\\nmonth. His perception of reality was changing.\\n\\nThere was the incident in the motel room. As Par sat in the Las Vegas\\nTravelodge on one if his cross-country treks, he perceived someone\\nmoving around in the room below his. Par strained to hear. It seemed\\nlike the man was talking to him. What was the man trying to tell him?\\nPar couldn't quite catch the words, but the more he listened, the more\\nPar was sure he had a message for him which he didn't want anyone else\\nto hear. It was very frustrating. No matter how hard he tried, no\\nmatter how he put his ear down to the floor or against the wall, Par\\ncouldn't make it out.\\n\\nThe surreal experiences continued. As Par described it, on a trip down\\nto Mexico, he began feeling quite strange, so he went to the US\\nconsulate late one afternoon to get some help. But everyone in the\\nconsulate behaved bizarrely.\\n\\nThey asked him for some identification, and he gave them his wallet.\\nThey took his Social Security card and his California identification\\ncard and told him to wait. Par believed they were going to pull up\\ninformation about him on a computer out the back. While waiting, his\\nlegs began to tremble and a continuous shiver rolled up and down his\\nspine. It wasn't a smooth, fluid shiver, it was jerky. He felt like he\\nwas sitting at the epicentre of an earthquake and it frightened him.\\nThe consulate staff just stared\\nat him.\\n\\nFinally Par stopped shaking. The other staff member returned and asked\\nhim to leave.\\n\\n`No-one can help you here,' he told Par.\\n\\nWhy was the consular official talking to him like that? What did he\\nmean--Par had to leave? What was he really trying to say? Par couldn't\\nunderstand him. Another consular officer came around to Par, carrying\\nhandcuffs. Why was everyone behaving in such a weird way? That\\ncomputer. Maybe they had found some special message next to his name\\non that computer.\\n\\nPar tried to explain the situation, but the consulate staff didn't\\nseem to understand. He told them about how he had been on the run from\\nthe Secret Service for two and a half years, but that just got him\\nqueer looks. Blank faces. No comprehende. The more he explained, the\\nblanker the faces became.\\n\\nThe consular officials told him that the office was closing for the\\nday. He would have to leave the building. But Par suspected that was\\njust an excuse. A few minutes later, a Mexican policeman showed up. He\\ntalked with one of the consular officials, who subsequently handed him\\nwhat Par perceived to be a slip of paper wrapped around a wad of peso\\nnotes.\\n\\nTwo more policemen came into the consulate. One of them turned to Par\\nand said, `Leave!' but Par didn't answer. So the Mexican police\\ngrabbed Par by the arms and legs and carried him out of the consulate.\\nPar felt agitated and confused and, as they crossed the threshold out\\nof the consulate, he screamed.\\n\\nThey put him in a police car and took him to a jail, where they kept\\nhim overnight.\\n\\nThe next day, they released Par and he wandered the city aimlessly\\nbefore ending up back at the US consulate. The same consular officer\\ncame up to him and asked how he was feeling.\\n\\nPar said, `OK.'\\n\\nThen Par asked if the official could help him get back to the border,\\nand he said he could. A few minutes later a white van picked up Par\\nand took him to the border crossing. When they arrived, Par asked the\\ndriver if he could have $2 so he could buy a ticket for the train. The\\ndriver gave it to him.\\n\\nPar boarded the train with no idea of where he was headed.\\n\\n\\nTheorem visited Par in California twice in 1992 and the relationship\\ncontinued to blossom. Par tried to find work so he could pay her back\\nthe $20000 she had lent him during his years on the run and during his\\ncourt case, but it was hard going. People didn't seem to want to hire\\nhim.\\n\\n`You don't have any computer skills,' they told him. He calmly\\nexplained that, yes, he did indeed have computer skills.\\n\\n`Well, which university did you get your degree from?' they asked.\\n\\nNo, he hadn't got his skills at any university.\\n\\n`Well, which companies did you get your work experience from?'\\n\\nNo, he hadn't learned his skills while working for a company.\\n\\n`Well, what did you do from 1989 to 1992?' the temp agency staffer\\ninevitably asked in an exasperated voice.\\n\\n`I ... ah ... travelled around the country.' What else was Par going\\nto say? How could he possibly answer that question?\\n\\nIf he was lucky, the agency might land him a data-entry job at $8 per\\nhour. If he was less fortunate, he might end up doing clerical work\\nfor less than that.\\n\\nBy 1993, things had become a little rocky with Theorem. After four and\\na half years together, they broke up. The distance was too great, in\\nevery sense. Theorem wanted a more stable life--maybe not a\\ntraditional Swiss family with three children and a pretty chalet in\\nthe Alps, but something more than Par's transient life on the road.\\n\\nThe separation was excruciatingly painful for both of them.\\nConversation was strained for weeks after the decision. Theorem kept\\nthinking she had made a mistake. She kept wanting to ask Par to come\\nback. But she didn't.\\n\\nPar drowned himself in alcohol. Shots of tequila, one after the other.\\nScull it. Slam the glass down. Fill it to the top. Throw back another.\\nAfter a while, he passed out. Then he was violently ill for days, but\\nsomehow he didn't mind. It was cleansing to be so ill.\\n\\nSomewhere along the way, Rosen managed to get Par's things returned\\nfrom the Secret Service raids. He passed the outdated computer and\\nother equipment back to Par, along with disks, print-outs and notes.\\n\\nPar gathered up every shred of evidence from his case, along with a\\nbottle of Jack Daniels, and made a bonfire. He shredded print-outs,\\ndoused them in lighter fluid and set them alight. He fed the disks\\ninto the fire and watched them melt in the flames. He flipped through\\nthe pages and pages of notes and official reports and let them pull\\nout particular memories. Then he crumpled up each one and tossed it in\\nthe fire. He even sprinkled a little Jack Daniels across the top for\\ngood measure.\\n\\nAs he pulled the pages from a Secret Service report, making them into\\ntight paper balls, something caught his eye and made him wonder. Many\\nhackers around the world had been busted in a series of raids\\nfollowing the first Thanksgiving raid at Par's house back in 1988.\\nErik Bloodaxe, the MOD boys, the LOD boys, The Atlanta Three, Pad and\\nGandalf, the Australians--they had all been either busted or raided\\nduring 1989, 1990 and 1991.\\n\\nHow were the raids connected? Were the law-enforcement agencies on\\nthree different continents really organised enough to coordinate\\nworldwide attacks on hackers?\\n\\nThe Secret Service report gave him a clue. It said that in December\\n1988, two informants had called Secret Service special agents in\\nseparate divisions with information about Par. The informants--both\\nhackers--told the Secret Service that Par was not the `Citibank\\nhacker' the agency was looking for. They said the real `Citibank\\nhacker' was named Phoenix.\\n\\nPhoenix from Australia.\\n\\n                  \",\n",

Who was the Killer Tomato? Many believed\\nthey were either Stuart Gill, or that Gill had forged messages by them\\nor others on Bowen\\'s board. Was the underground rife with credit card\\nfrauders? No. They formed only a very small part of that community.\\nHad the Melbourne hackers stolen half a million dollars from Citibank?\\nAbsolutely not. A subsequent police investigation determined this\\nallegation to be a complete fabrication.\\n\\nHow had six months\\' worth of messages from PI and Zen found their way\\ninto the hands of the Victoria Police Bureau of Criminal Intelligence?\\nMembers of the underground had their suspicions.\\n\\nTo some, Stuart Gill\\'s role in the underground appeared to be that of\\nan information trader. He would feed a police agency information, and\\ngarner a little new material from it in exchange. He then amalgamated\\nthe new and old material and delivered the new package to another\\npolice agency, which provided him a little more material to add to the\\npot. Gill appeared to play the same game in the underground.\\n\\nA few members of the underground, particularly PI and Zen regulars\\nMentat and Brett MacMillan, suspected chicanery and began fighting a\\nBBS-based war to prove their point. In early 1989, MacMillan posted a\\nmessage stating that Hackwatch was not registered as a business\\ntrading name belonging to Stuart Gill at the Victorian Corporate\\nAffairs office. Further, he stated, DPG Monitoring Services did not\\nexist as an official registered business trading name either.\\nMacMillan then stunned the underground by announcing that he had\\nregistered the name Hackwatch himself, presumably to stop Stuart\\nGill\\'s media appearances as a Hackwatch spokesman.\\n\\nMany in the underground felt duped by Gill, but they weren\\'t the only\\nones. Soon some journalists and police would feel the same way. Stuart\\nGill wasn\\'t even his real name.\\n\\nWhat Gill really wanted, some citizens in the underground came to\\nbelieve, was a public platform from which he could whip up hacker hype\\nand then demand the introduction of tough new anti-hacking laws. In\\nmid-1989, the Commonwealth Government did just that, enacting the\\nfirst federal computer crime laws.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t the journalists\\' fault. For example, in one case Helen\\nMeredith had asked Gill for verification and he had referred her to\\nSuperintendent Tony Warren, of the Victoria Police, who had backed him\\nup. A reporter couldn\\'t ask for better verification than that.\\n\\nAnd why wouldn\\'t Warren back Gill? A registered ISU informer, Gill\\nalso acted as a consultant, adviser, confidant and friend to various\\nmembers of the Victoria Police. He was close to both Warren and,\\nlater, to Inspector Chris Cosgriff. From 1985 to 1987, Warren had\\nworked at the Bureau of Criminal Intelligence (BCI). After that, he\\nwas transferred to the Internal Investigations Department (IID), where\\nhe worked with Cosgriff who joined IID in 1988.\\n\\nOver a six-month period in 1992, Tony Warren received more than 200\\nphone calls from Stuart Gill--45 of them to his home number. Over an\\neighteen-month period in 1991-92, Chris Cosgriff made at least 76\\npersonal visits to Gill\\'s home address and recorded 316 phone calls\\nwith him.3\\n\\nThe Internal Security Unit (ISU) investigated corruption within the\\npolice force. If you had access to ISU, you knew everything that the\\nVictoria Police officially knew about corruption within its ranks. Its\\ninformation was highly sensitive, particularly since it could involve\\none police officer dobbing in another. However, a 1993 Victorian\\nOmbudsman\\'s report concluded that Cosgriff leaked a large amount of\\nconfidential ISU material to Gill, and that Warren\\'s relationship with\\nGill was inappropriate.4\\n\\nWhen Craig Bowen (aka Thunderbird1) came to believe in 1989 that he\\nhad been duped by Gill, he retreated into a state of denial and\\ndepression. The PI community had trusted him. He entered his\\nfriendship with Gill a bright-eyed, innocent young man looking for\\nadventure. He left the friendship betrayed and gun-shy.\\n\\nSad-eyed and feeling dark on the world, Craig Bowen turned off PI and\\nZen forever.\\n\\n\\nSitting at his computer sometime in the second half of 1989, Force\\nstared at his screen without seeing anything, his mind a million miles\\naway. The situation was bad, very bad, and lost in thought, he toyed\\nwith his mouse absent-mindedly, thinking about how to deal with this\\nproblem.\\n\\nThe problem was that someone in Melbourne was going to be busted.\\n\\nForce wanted to discount the secret warning, to rack it up as just\\nanother in a long line of rumours which swept through the underground\\nperiodically, but he knew he couldn\\'t do that. The warning was rock\\nsolid; it had come from Gavin.*\\n\\nThe way Force told it, his friend Gavin worked as a contractor to\\nTelecom by day and played at hacking at night. He was Force\\'s little\\nsecret, who he kept from the other members of The Realm. Gavin was\\ndefinitely not part of the hacker BBS scene. He was older, he didn\\'t\\neven have a handle and he hacked alone, or with Force, because he saw\\nhacking in groups as risky.\\n\\nAs a Telecom contractor, Gavin had the kind of access to computers and\\nnetworks which most hackers could only dream about. He also had good\\ncontacts inside Telecom--the kind who might answer a few tactfully\\nworded questions about telephone taps and line traces, or might know a\\nbit about police investigations requiring Telecom\\'s help.\\n\\nForce had met Gavin while buying some second-hand equipment through\\nthe Trading Post. They hit it off, became friends and soon began\\nhacking together. Under the cover of darkness, they would creep into\\nGavin\\'s office after everyone else had gone home and hack all night.\\nAt dawn, they tidied up and quietly left the building. Gavin went\\nhome, showered and returned to work as if nothing had happened.\\n\\nGavin introduced Force to trashing. When they weren\\'t spending the\\nnight in front of his terminal, Gavin crawled through Telecom\\'s\\ndumpsters looking for pearls of information on crumpled bits of office\\npaper. Account names, passwords, dial-up modems, NUAs--people wrote\\nall sorts of things down on scrap paper and then threw it out the next\\nday when they didn\\'t need it any more.\\n\\nAccording to Force, Gavin moved offices frequently, which made it\\neasier to muddy the trail. Even better, he worked from offices which\\nhad dozens of employees making hundreds of calls each day. Gavin and\\nForce\\'s illicit activities were buried under a mound of daily\\nlegitimate transactions.\\n\\nThe two hackers trusted each other; in fact Gavin was the only person\\nto whom Force revealed the exact address of the CitiSaudi machine. Not\\neven Phoenix, rising star of The Realm and Force\\'s favoured protÃ©gÃ©,\\nwas privy to all the secrets of Citibank uncovered during Force\\'s\\nnetwork explorations.\\n\\nForce had shared some of this glittering prize with Phoenix, but not\\nall of it. Just a few of the Citibank cards--token trophies--and\\ngeneral information about the Citibank network. Believing the\\ntemptation to collect vast numbers of cards and use them would be too\\ngreat for the young Phoenix, Force tried to keep the exact location of\\nthe Citibank machine a secret. He knew that Phoenix might eventually\\nfind the Citibank system on his own, and there was little he could do\\nto stop him. But Force was determined that he wouldn\\'t help Phoenix\\nget himself into trouble.\\n\\nThe Citibank network had been a rich source of systems--something\\nForce also kept to himself. The more he explored, the more he found in\\nthe network. Soon after his first discovery of the CitiSaudi system,\\nhe found a machine called CitiGreece which was just as willing to dump\\ncard details as its Saudi-American counterpart. Out of fifteen or so\\ncredit cards Force discovered on the system, only two appeared to be\\nvalid. He figured the others were test cards and that this must be a\\nnew site. Not long after the discovery of the CitiGreece machine, he\\ndiscovered similar embryonic sites in two other countries.\\n\\nForce liked Phoenix and was impressed by the new hacker\\'s enthusiasm\\nand desire to learn about computer networks.\\n\\nForce introduced Phoenix to Minerva, just as Craig Bowen had done for\\nForce some years before. Phoenix learned quickly and came back for\\nmore. He was hungry and, in Force\\'s discerning opinion, very bright.\\nIndeed, Force saw a great deal of himself in the young hacker. They\\nwere from a similarly comfortable, educated middle-class background.\\nThey were also both a little outside the mainstream. Force\\'s family\\nwere migrants to Australia. Some of Phoenix\\'s family lived in Israel,\\nand his family was very religious.\\n\\nPhoenix attended one of the most Orthodox Jewish schools in Victoria,\\na place which described itself as a `modern orthodox Zionist\\'\\ninstitution. Nearly half the subjects offered in year 9 were in Jewish\\nStudies, all the boys wore yarmulkes and the school expected students\\nto be fluent in Hebrew by the time they graduated.\\n\\nIn his first years at the school, Phoenix had acquired the nickname\\n`The Egg\\'. Over the following years he became a master at playing the\\ngame--jumping through hoops to please teachers. He learned that doing\\nwell in religious studies was a good way to ingratiate himself to\\nteachers, as well as his parents and, in their eyes at least, he\\nbecame the golden-haired boy.\\n\\nAnyone scratching below the surface, however, would find the shine of\\nthe golden-haired boy was merely gilt. Despite his success in school\\nand his matriculation, Phoenix was having trouble. He had been\\nprofoundly affected by the bitter break-up and divorce of his parents\\nwhen he was about fourteen.\\n\\nAfter the divorce, Phoenix was sent to boarding school in Israel for\\nabout six months. On his return to Melbourne, he lived with his\\nyounger sister and mother at his maternal grandmother\\'s house. His\\nbrother, the middle child, lived with his father.\\n\\nSchool friends sometimes felt awkward visiting Phoenix at home. One of\\nhis best friends found it difficult dealing with Phoenix\\'s mother,\\nwhose vivacity sometimes bordered on the neurotic and shrill. His\\ngrandmother was a chronic worrier, who pestered Phoenix about using\\nthe home phone line during thunderstorms for fear he would be\\nelectrocuted. The situation with Phoenix\\'s father wasn\\'t much better.\\nA manager at Telecom, he seemed to waver between appearing\\ndisinterested or emotionally cold and breaking into violent outbursts\\nof anger.\\n\\nBut it was Phoenix\\'s younger brother who seemed to be the problem\\nchild. He ran away from home at around seventeen and dealt in drugs\\nbefore eventually finding his feet. Yet, unlike Phoenix, his brother\\'s\\nproblems had been laid bare for all to see. Hitting rock bottom forced\\nhim to take stock of his life and come to terms with his situation.\\n\\nIn contrast, Phoenix found less noticeable ways of expressing his\\nrebellion. Among them was his enthusiasm for tools of power--the\\nmartial arts, weapons such as swords and staffs, and social\\nengineering. During his final years of secondary school, while still\\nliving at his grandmother\\'s home, Phoenix took up hacking. He hung\\naround various Melbourne BBSes, and then he developed an on-line\\nfriendship with Force.\\n\\nForce watched Phoenix\\'s hacking skills develop with interest and after\\na couple of months he invited him to join The Realm. It was the\\nshortest initiation of any Realm member, and the vote to include the\\nnew hacker was unanimous. Phoenix proved to be a valuable member,\\ncollecting information about new systems and networks for The Realm\\'s\\ndatabases. At their peak of hacking activity, Force and Phoenix spoke\\non the phone almost every day.\\n\\nPhoenix\\'s new-found acceptance contrasted with the position of\\nElectron, who visited The Realm regularly for a few months in 1988. As\\nPhoenix basked in the warmth of Force\\'s approval, the\\neighteen-year-old Electron felt the chill of his increasing scorn.\\n\\nForce eventually turfed Electron and his friend, Powerspike, out of\\nhis exclusive Melbourne club of hackers. Well, that was how Force told\\nit. He told the other members of The Realm that Electron had committed\\ntwo major sins. The first was that he had been wasting resources by\\nusing accounts on OTC\\'s Minerva system to connect to Altos, which\\nmeant the accounts would be immediately tracked and killed.\\n\\nMinerva admins such as Michael Rosenberg--sworn enemy of The\\nRealm--recognised the Altos NUA. Rosenberg was OTC\\'s best defence\\nagainst hackers. He had spent so much time trying to weed them out of\\nMinerva that he knew their habits by heart: hack, then zoom over to\\nAltos for a chat with fellow hackers, then hack some more.\\n\\nMost accounts on Minerva were held by corporations. How many\\nlegitimate users from ANZ Bank would visit Altos? None. So when\\nRosenberg saw an account connecting to Altos, he silently observed\\nwhat the hacker was doing--in case he bragged on the German chat\\nboard--then changed the password and notified the client, in an effort\\nto lock the hacker out for good.\\n\\nElectron\\'s second sin, according to Force, was that he had been\\nwithholding hacking information from the rest of the group. Force\\'s\\nstated view--though it didn\\'t seem to apply to him personally--was one\\nin, all in.\\n\\nIt was a very public expulsion. Powerspike and Electron told each\\nother they didn\\'t really care. As they saw it, they might have visited\\nThe Realm BBS now and then but they certainly weren\\'t members of The\\nRealm. Electron joked with Powerspike, `Who would want to be a member\\nof a no-talent outfit like The Realm?\\' Still, it must have hurt.\\nHackers in the period 1988-90 depended on each other for information.\\nThey honed their skills in a community which shared intelligence and\\nthey grew to rely on the pool of information.\\n\\nMonths later, Force grudgingly allowing Electron to rejoin The Realm,\\nbut the relationship remained testy. When Electron finally logged in\\nagain, he found a file in the BBS entitled `Scanner stolen from the\\nElectron\\'. Force had found a copy of Electron\\'s VMS scanner on an\\noverseas computer while Electron was in exile and had felt no qualms\\nabout pinching it for The Realm.\\n\\nExcept that it wasn\\'t a scanner. It was a VMS Trojan. And there was a\\nbig difference. It didn\\'t scan for the addresses of computers on a\\nnetwork. It snagged passwords when people connected from their VMS\\ncomputers to another machine over an X.25 network. Powerspike cracked\\nup laughing when Electron told him. `Well,\\' he told Powerspike, `Mr\\nBigshot Force might know something about Prime computers, but he\\ndoesn\\'t know a hell of a lot about VMS.\\'\\n\\nDespite Electron\\'s general fall from grace, Phoenix talked to the\\noutcast because they shared the obsession. Electron was on a steep\\nlearning curve and, like Phoenix, he was moving fast--much faster than\\nany of the other Melbourne hackers.\\n\\nWhen Phoenix admitted talking to Electron regularly, Force tried to\\npull him away, but without luck. Some of the disapproval was born of\\nForce\\'s paternalistic attitude toward the Australian hacking scene. He\\nconsidered himself to be a sort of godfather in the hacking community.\\nBut Force was also increasingly concerned at Phoenix\\'s ever more\\nflagrant taunting of computer security bigwigs and system admins. In\\none incident, Phoenix knew a couple of system admins and security\\npeople were waiting on a system to trap him by tracing his network\\nconnections. He responded by sneaking into the computer unnoticed and\\nquietly logging off each admin. Force laughed about it at the time,\\nbut privately the story made him more than a little nervous.\\n\\nPhoenix enjoyed pitting himself against the pinnacles of the computer\\nsecurity industry. He wanted to prove he was better, and he frequently\\nupset people because often he was. Strangely, though, Force\\'s protÃ©gÃ©\\nalso thought that if he told these experts about a few of the holes in\\ntheir systems, he would somehow gain their approval. Maybe they would\\neven give him inside information, like new penetration techniques,\\nand, importantly, look after him if things got rough. Force wondered\\nhow Phoenix could hold two such conflicting thoughts in his mind at\\nthe same time without questioning the logic of either.\\n\\nIt was against this backdrop that Gavin came to Force with his urgent\\nwarning in late 1989. Gavin had learned that the Australian Federal\\nPolice were getting complaints about hackers operating out of\\nMelbourne. The Melbourne hacking community had become very noisy and\\nwas leaving footprints all over the place as its members traversed the\\nworld\\'s data networks.\\n\\nThere were other active hacking communities outside Australia--in the\\nnorth of England, in Texas, in New York. But the Melbourne hackers\\nweren\\'t just noisy--they were noisy inside American computers. It\\nwasn\\'t just a case of American hackers breaking into American systems.\\nThis was about foreign nationals penetrating American computers. And\\nthere was something else which made the Australian hackers a target.\\nThe US Secret Service knew an Australian named Phoenix had been inside\\nCitibank, one of the biggest financial institutions in the US.\\n\\nGavin didn\\'t have many details to give Force. All he knew was that an\\nAmerican law enforcement agency--probably the Secret Service--had been\\nputting enormous pressure on the Australian government to bust these\\npeople.\\n\\nWhat Gavin didn\\'t know was that the Secret Service wasn\\'t the only\\nsource of pressure coming from the other side of the Pacific. The FBI\\nhad also approached the Australian Federal Police about the mysterious\\nbut noisy Australian hackers who kept breaking into American systems,5\\nand the AFP had acted on the information.\\n\\nIn late 1989, Detective Superintendent Ken Hunt of the AFP headed an\\ninvestigation into the Melbourne hackers. It was believed to be the\\nfirst major investigation of computer crime since the introduction of\\nAustralia\\'s first federal anti-hacking laws. Like most law enforcement\\nagencies around the world, the AFP were new players in the field of\\ncomputer crime. Few officers had expertise in computers, let alone\\ncomputer crime, so this case would prove to be an important proving\\nground.6\\n\\nWhen Gavin broke the news, Force acted immediately. He called Phoenix\\non the phone, insisting on meeting him in person as soon as possible.\\nAs their friendship had progressed, they had moved from talking\\non-line to telephone conversations and finally to spending time\\ntogether in person. Force sat Phoenix down alone and gave him a stern\\nwarning. He didn\\'t tell him how he got his information, but he made it\\nclear the source was reliable.\\n\\nThe word was that the police felt they had to bust someone. It had\\ncome to the point where an American law enforcement officer had\\nreportedly told his Australian counterpart, `If you don\\'t do something\\nabout it soon, we\\'ll do something about it ourselves\\'. The American\\nhadn\\'t bothered to elaborate on just how they might do something about\\nit, but it didn\\'t matter.\\n\\nPhoenix looked suddenly pale. He had certainly been very noisy, and\\nwas breaking into systems virtually all the time now. Many of those\\nsystems were in the US.\\n\\nHe certainly didn\\'t want to end up like the West German hacker\\nHagbard, whose petrol-doused, charred remains had been discovered in a\\nGerman forest in June 1989.\\n\\nAn associate of Pengo\\'s, Hagbard had been involved in a ring of German\\nhackers who sold the information they found in American computers to a\\nKGB agent in East Germany from 1986 to 1988.\\n\\nIn March 1989, German police raided the homes and offices of the\\nGerman hacking group and began arresting people. Like Pengo, Hagbard\\nhad secretly turned himself into the German authorities months before\\nand given full details of the hacking ring\\'s activities in the hope of\\ngaining immunity from prosecution.\\n\\nAmerican law enforcement agencies and prosecutors had not been\\nenthusiastic about showing the hackers any leniency. Several US\\nagencies, including the CIA and the FBI, had been chasing the German\\nespionage ring and they wanted stiff sentences, preferably served in\\nan American prison.\\n\\nGerman court proceedings were under way when Hagbard\\'s body was found.\\nDid he commit suicide or was he murdered? No-one knew for sure, but\\nthe news shook the computer underground around the world. Hackers\\ndiscussed the issue in considerable depth. On the one hand, Hagbard\\nhad a long history of mental instability and drug use, having spent\\ntime in psychiatric hospitals and detoxification centres off and on\\nsince the beginning of 1987. On the other hand, if you were going to\\nkill yourself, would you really want to die in the agony of a petrol\\nfire? Or would you just take a few too many pills or a quick bullet?\\n\\nWhether it was murder or suicide, the death of Hagbard loomed large\\nbefore Phoenix. Who were the American law enforcement agencies after\\nin Australia? Did they want him?\\n\\nNo. Force reassured him, they were after Electron. The problem for\\nPhoenix was that he kept talking to Electron on the phone--in voice\\nconversations. If Phoenix continued associating with Electron, he too\\nwould be scooped up in the AFP\\'s net.\\n\\nThe message to Phoenix was crystal clear.\\n\\nStay away from Electron.\\n\\n\\n`Listen, you miserable scum-sucking pig.\\'\\n\\n`Huh?\\' Phoenix answered, only half paying attention.\\n\\n`Piece of s**t machine. I did all this editing and the damn thing\\ndidn\\'t save the changes,\\' Electron growled at the Commodore Amiga,\\nwith its 512 k of memory, sitting on the desk in his bedroom.\\n\\nIt was January 1990 and both Phoenix and Electron were at home on\\nholidays before the start of university.\\n\\n`Yeah. Wish I could get this thing working. f**king hell. Work you!\\'\\nPhoenix yelled. Electron could hear him typing at the other end of the\\nphone while he talked. He had been struggling to get AUX, the Apple\\nversion of Unix, running on his Macintosh SE30 for days.\\n\\nIt was difficult to have an uninterrupted conversation with Phoenix.\\nIf it wasn\\'t his machine crashing, it was his grandmother asking him\\nquestions from the doorway of his room.\\n\\n`You wanna go through the list? How big is your file?\\' Phoenix asked,\\nnow more focused on the conversation.\\n\\n`Huh? Which file?\\'\\n\\n`The dictionary file. The words to feed into the password cracker,\\'\\nPhoenix replied.\\n\\nElectron pulled up his list of dictionary words and looked\\nat it. I\\'m going to have to cut this list down a bit, he thought. The\\ndictionary was part of the password cracking program.\\nThe larger the dictionary, the longer it took the computer to crack a\\nlist of passwords. If he could weed out obscure words--words that\\npeople were unlikely to pick as passwords--then he could make his\\ncracker run faster.\\n\\nAn efficient password cracker was a valuable tool. Electron would feed\\nhis home computer a password file from a target computer, say from\\nMelbourne University, then go to bed. About twelve hours later, he\\nwould check on his machine\\'s progress.\\n\\nIf he was lucky, he would find six or more accounts--user names and\\ntheir passwords--waiting for him in a file. The process was completely\\nautomated. Electron could then log into Melbourne University using the\\ncracked accounts, all of which could be used as jumping-off points for\\nhacking into other systems for the price of a local telephone call.\\n\\nCracking Unix passwords wasn\\'t inordinately difficult,\\nprovided the different components of the program, such as the\\ndictionary, had been set up properly. However, it was time-consuming.\\nThe principle was simple. Passwords, kept in password files with their\\ncorresponding user names, were encrypted. It was as impossible to\\nreverse the encryption process as it was to unscramble an omelette.\\nInstead, you needed to recreate the encryption process and compare the\\nresults.\\n\\nThere were three basic steps. First, target a computer and get a copy\\nof its password file. Second, take a list of commonly used passwords,\\nsuch as users\\' names from the password file or words from a\\ndictionary, and encrypt those into a second list. Third, put the two\\nlists side by side and compare them. When you have a match, you have\\nfound the password.\\n\\nHowever, there was one important complication: salts. A salt changed\\nthe way a password was encrypted, subtly modifying the way the DES\\nencryption algorithm worked. For example, the word `Underground\\'\\nencrypts two different ways with two different salts: `kyvbExMcdAOVM\\'\\nor `lhFaTmw4Ddrjw\\'. The first two characters represent the salt, the\\nothers represent the password. The computer chooses a salt randomly\\nwhen it encrypts a user\\'s password. Only one is used, and there are\\n4096 different salts. All Unix computers use salts in their password\\nencryption process.\\n\\nSalts were intended to make password cracking far more difficult, so a\\nhacker couldn\\'t just encrypt a dictionary once and then compare it to\\nevery list of encrypted passwords he came across in his hacking\\nintrusions. The 4096 salts mean that a hacker would have to use 4096\\ndifferent dictionaries--each encrypted with a different salt--to\\ndiscover any dictionary word passwords.\\n\\nOn any one system penetrated by Electron, there might be only 25\\nusers, and therefore only 25 passwords, most likely using 25 different\\nsalts. Since the salt characters were stored immediately before the\\nencrypted password, he could easily see which salt was being used for\\na particular password. He would therefore only have to encrypt a\\ndictionary 25 different times.\\n\\nStill, even encrypting a large dictionary 25 times using different\\nsalts took up too much hard-drive space for a basic home computer. And\\nthat was just the dictionary. The most sophisticated cracking programs\\nalso produced `intelligent guesses\\' of passwords. For example, the\\nprogram might take the user\\'s name and try it in both upper- and\\nlower-case letters. It might also add a `1\\' at the end. In short, the\\nprogram would create new guesses by permutating, shuffling, reversing\\nand recombining basic information such as a user\\'s name into new\\n`words\\'.\\n\\n`It\\'s 24000 words. Too damn big,\\' Electron said. Paring down a\\ndictionary was a game of trade-offs. The fewer words in a cracking\\ndictionary, the less time it was likely to take a computer to break\\nthe encrypted passwords. A smaller dictionary, however, also meant\\nfewer guesses and so a reduced chance of cracking the password of any\\ngiven account.\\n\\n`Hmm. Mine\\'s 24328. We better pare it down together.\\'\\n\\n`Yeah. OK. Pick a letter.\\'\\n\\n`C. Let\\'s start with the Cs.\\'\\n\\n`Why C?\\'\\n\\n`C. For my grandmother\\'s cat, Cocoa.\\'\\n\\n`Yeah. OK. Here goes. Cab, Cabal. Cabala. Cabbala.\\' Electron paused.\\n`What the f**k is a Cabbala?\\'\\n\\n`Dunno. Yeah. I\\'ve got those. Not Cabbala. OK, Cabaret. Cabbage. f**k,\\nI hate cabbage. Who\\'d pick Cabbage as their password?\\'\\n\\n`A Pom,\\' Electron answered.\\n\\n`Yeah,\\' Phoenix laughed before continuing.\\n\\nPhoenix sometimes stopped to think about Force\\'s warning, but usually\\nhe just pushed it to one side when it crept, unwelcomed, into his\\nthoughts. Still, it worried him. Force took it seriously enough. Not\\nonly had he stopped associating with Electron, he appeared to have\\ngone very, very quiet.\\n\\nIn fact, Force had found a new love: music. He was writing and\\nperforming his own songs. By early 1990 he seemed so busy with his\\nmusic that he had essentially put The Realm on ice. Its members took\\nto congregating on a machine owned by another Realm member, Nom, for a\\nmonth or so.\\n\\nSomehow, however, Phoenix knew that wasn\\'t all of the story. A hacker\\ndidn\\'t pick up and walk away from hacking just like that. Especially\\nnot Force. Force had been obsessed with hacking. It just didn\\'t make\\nsense. There had to be something more. Phoenix comforted himself with\\nthe knowledge that he had followed Force\\'s advice and had stayed away\\nfrom Electron. Well, for a while anyway.\\n\\nHe had backed right off, watched and waited, but nothing happened.\\nElectron was as active in the underground as ever but he hadn\\'t been\\nbusted. Nothing had changed. Maybe Force\\'s information had been wrong.\\nSurely the feds would have busted Electron by now if they were going\\nto do anything. So Phoenix began to rebuild his relationship with\\nElectron. It was just too tempting. Phoenix was determined not to let\\nForce\\'s ego impede his own progress.\\n\\nBy January 1990, Electron was hacking almost all the time. The only\\ntime he wasn\\'t hacking was when he was sleeping, and even then he\\noften dreamed of hacking. He and Phoenix were sailing past all the\\nother Melbourne hackers. Electron had grown beyond Powerspike\\'s\\nexpertise just as Phoenix had accelerated past Force. They were moving\\naway from X.25 networks and into the embryonic Internet, which was\\njust as illegal since the universities guarded computer\\naccounts--Internet access--very closely.\\n\\nEven Nom, with his growing expertise in the Unix operating system\\nwhich formed the basis of many new Internet sites, wasn\\'t up to\\nElectron\\'s standard. He didn\\'t have the same level of commitment to\\nhacking, the same obsession necessary to be a truly cutting-edge\\nhacker. In many ways, the relationship between Nom and Phoenix\\nmirrored the relationship between Electron and Powerspike: the support\\nact to the main band.\\n\\nElectron didn\\'t consider Phoenix a close friend, but he was a kindred\\nspirit. In fact he didn\\'t trust Phoenix, who had a big mouth, a big\\nego and a tight friendship with Force--all strikes against him. But\\nPhoenix was intelligent and he wanted to learn. Most of all, he had\\nthe obsession. Phoenix contributed to a flow of information which\\nstimulated Electron intellectually, even if more information flowed\\ntoward Phoenix than from him.\\n\\nWithin a month, Phoenix and Electron were in regular contact, and\\nduring the summer holidays they were talking on the phone--voice--all\\nthe time, sometimes three or four times a day. Hack then talk. Compare\\nnotes. Hack some more. Check in again, ask a few questions. Then back\\nto hacking.\\n\\nThe actual hacking was generally a solo act. For a social animal like\\nPhoenix, it was a lonely pursuit. While many hackers revelled in the\\nintense isolation, some, such as Phoenix, also needed to check in with\\nfellow humanity once in a while. Not just any humanity--those who\\nunderstood and shared in the obsession.\\n\\n`Caboodle. Caboose, `Electron went on, `Cabriolet. What the hell is a\\nCabriolet? Do you know?\\'\\n\\n`Yeah,\\' Phoenix answered, then rushed on. `OK. Cacao. Cache. Cachet\\n...\\'\\n\\n`Tell us. What is it?\\' Electron cut Phoenix off.\\n\\n`Cachinnation. Cachou ...\\'\\n\\n`Do you know?\\' Electron asked again, slightly irritated. As usual,\\nPhoenix was claiming to know things he probably didn\\'t.\\n\\n`Hmm? Uh, yeah,\\' Phoenix answered weakly. `Cackle. Cacophony ...\\'\\n\\nElectron knew that particular Phoenix `yeah\\'--the one which said `yes\\'\\nbut meant `no, and I don\\'t want to own up to it either so let\\'s drop\\nit\\'.\\n\\nElectron made it a habit not to believe most of the things Phoenix\\ntold him. Unless there was some solid proof, Electron figured it was\\njust hot air. He didn\\'t actually like Phoenix much as a person, and\\nfound talking to him difficult at times. He preferred the company of\\nhis fellow hacker Powerspike.\\n\\nPowerspike was both bright and creative. Electron clicked with him.\\nThey often joked about the other\\'s bad taste in music. Powerspike\\nliked heavy metal, and Electron liked indie music. They shared a\\nhealthy disrespect for authority. Not just the authority of places\\nthey hacked into, like the US Naval Research Laboratories or NASA, but\\nthe authority of The Realm. When it came to politics, they both leaned\\nto the left. However, their interest tended more toward\\nanarchy--opposing symbols of the military-industrial complex--than to\\njoining a political party.\\n\\nAfter their expulsion from The Realm, Electron had been a little\\nisolated for a time. The tragedy of his personal life had contributed\\nto the isolation. At the age of eight, he had seen his mother die of\\nlung cancer. He hadn\\'t witnessed the worst parts of her dying over two\\nyears, as she had spent some time in a German cancer clinic hoping for\\na reprieve. She had, however, come home to die, and Electron had\\nwatched her fade away.\\n\\nWhen the phone call from hospital came one night, Electron could tell\\nwhat had happened from the serious tones of the adults. He burst into\\ntears. He could hear his father answering questions on the phone. Yes,\\nthe boy had taken it hard. No, his sister seemed to be OK. Two years\\nyounger than Electron, she was too young to understand.\\n\\nElectron had never been particularly close to his sister. He viewed\\nher as an unfeeling, shallow person--someone who simply skimmed along\\nthe surface of life. But after their mother\\'s death, their father\\nbegan to favour Electron\\'s sister, perhaps because of her resemblance\\nto his late wife. This drove a deeper, more subtle wedge between\\nbrother and sister.\\n\\nElectron\\'s father, a painter who taught art at a local high school,\\nwas profoundly affected by his wife\\'s death. Despite some barriers of\\nsocial class and money, theirs had been a marriage of great affection\\nand love and they made a happy home. Electron\\'s father\\'s paintings\\nhung on almost every wall in the house, but after his wife\\'s death he\\nput down his brushes and never took them up again. He didn\\'t talk\\nabout it. Once, Electron asked him why he didn\\'t paint any more. He\\nlooked away and told Electron that he had `lost the motivation\\'.\\n\\nElectron\\'s grandmother moved into the home to help her son care for\\nhis two children, but she developed Alzheimer\\'s disease. The children\\nended up caring for her. As a teenager, Electron thought it was\\nmaddening caring for someone who couldn\\'t even remember your name.\\nEventually, she moved into a nursing home.\\n\\nIn August 1989, Electron\\'s father arrived home from the doctor\\'s\\noffice. He had been mildly ill for some time, but refused to take time\\noff work to visit a doctor. He was proud of having taken only one\\nday\\'s sick leave in the last five years. Finally, in the holidays, he\\nhad seen a doctor who had conducted numerous tests. The results had\\ncome in.\\n\\nElectron\\'s father had bowel cancer and the disease had spread. It\\ncould not be cured. He had two years to live at the most.\\n\\nElectron was nineteen years old at the time, and his early love of the\\ncomputer, and particularly the modem, had already turned into a\\npassion. Several years earlier his father, keen to encourage his\\nfascination with the new machines, used to bring one of the school\\'s\\nApple IIes home over weekends and holidays. Electron spent hours at\\nthe borrowed machine. When he wasn\\'t playing on the computer, he read,\\nplucking one of his father\\'s spy novels from the over-crowded\\nbookcases, or his own favourite book, The Lord of The Rings.\\n\\nComputer programming had, however, captured the imagination of the\\nyoung Electron years before he used his first computer. At the age of\\neleven he was using books to write simple programs on paper--mostly\\ngames--despite the fact that he had never actually touched a keyboard.\\n\\nHis school may have had a few computers, but its administrators had\\nlittle understanding of what to do with them. In year 9, Electron had\\nmet with the school\\'s career counsellor, hoping to learn about career\\noptions working with computers.\\n\\n`I think maybe I\\'d like to do a course in computer programming ...\\'\\nHis voice trailed off, hesitantly.\\n\\n`Why would you want to do that?\\' she said. `Can\\'t you think of\\nanything better than that?\\'\\n\\n`Uhm ...\\' Electron was at a loss. He didn\\'t know what to do. That was\\nwhy he had come to her. He cast around for something which seemed a\\nmore mainstream career option but which might also let him work on\\ncomputers. `Well, accounting maybe?\\'\\n\\n`Oh yes, that\\'s much better,\\' she said.\\n\\n`You can probably even get into a university, and study accounting\\nthere. I\\'m sure you will enjoy it,\\' she added, smiling as she closed\\nhis file.\\n\\nThe borrowed computers were, in Electron\\'s opinion, one of the few\\ngood things about school. He did reasonably well at school, but only\\nbecause it didn\\'t take much effort. Teachers consistently told his\\nfather that Electron was underachieving and that he distracted the\\nother students in class. For the most part, the criticism was just\\nlow-level noise. Occasionally, however, Electron had more serious\\nrun-ins with his teachers. Some thought he was gifted. Others thought\\nthe freckle-faced, Irish-looking boy who helped his friends set fire\\nto textbooks at the back of the class was nothing but a smart alec.\\n\\nWhen he was sixteen, Electron bought his own computer. He used it to\\ncrack software protection, just as Par had done. The Apple was soon\\nreplaced by a more powerful Amiga with a 20 megabyte IBM compatible\\nsidecar. The computers lived, in succession, on one of the two desks\\nin his bedroom. The second desk, for his school work, was usually\\npiled high with untouched assignments.\\n\\nThe most striking aspect of Electron\\'s room was the ream after ream of\\ndot matrix computer print-out which littered the floor. Standing at\\nalmost any point in the simply furnished room, someone could reach out\\nand grab at least one pile of print-outs, most of which contained\\neither usernames and passwords or printed computer program code. In\\nbetween the piles of print-outs, were T-shirts, jeans, sneakers and\\nbooks on the floor. It was impossible to walk across Electron\\'s room\\nwithout stepping on something.\\n\\nThe turning point for Electron was the purchase of a second-hand 300\\nbaud modem in 1986. Overnight, the modem transformed Electron\\'s love\\nof the computer into an obsession. During the semester immediately\\nbefore the modem\\'s arrival, Electron\\'s report card showed six As and\\none B. The following semester he earned six Bs and only one A.\\n\\nElectron had moved onto bigger and better things than school. He\\nquickly became a regular user of underground BBSes and began hacking.\\nHe was enthralled by an article he discovered describing how several\\nhackers claimed to have moved a satellite around in space simply by\\nhacking computers. From that moment on, Electron decided he wanted to\\nhack--to find out if the article was true.\\n\\nBefore he graduated from school in 1987, Electron had hacked NASA, an\\nachievement which saw him dancing around the dining room table in the\\nmiddle of the night chanting, `I got into NASA! I got into NASA!\\' He\\nhadn\\'t moved any satellites, but getting into the space agency was as\\nthrilling as flying to the moon.\\n\\nBy 1989, he had been hacking regularly for years, much to the chagrin\\nof his sister, who claimed her social life suffered because the\\nfamily\\'s sole phone line was always tied up by the modem.\\n\\nFor Phoenix, Electron was a partner in hacking, and to a lesser degree\\na mentor. Electron had a lot to offer, by that time even more than The\\nRealm.\\n\\n`Cactus, Cad, Cadaver, Caddis, Cadence, Cadet, Caesura. What the f**k\\nis a Caesura?\\' Phoenix kept ploughing through the Cs.\\n\\n`Dunno. Kill that,\\' Electron answered, distracted.\\n\\n`Caesura. Well, f**k. I know I\\'d wanna use that as a password.\\'\\nPhoenix laughed. `What the hell kind of word is Caduceus?\\'\\n\\n`A dead one. Kill all those. Who makes up these dictionaries?\\'\\nElectron said.\\n\\n`Yeah.\\'\\n\\n`Caisson, Calabash. Kill those. Kill, kill, kill,\\' Electron said\\ngleefully.\\n\\n`Hang on. How come I don\\'t have Calabash in my list?\\' Phoenix feigned\\nindignation.\\n\\nElectron laughed.\\n\\n`Hey,\\' Phoenix said, `we should put in words like \"Qwerty\" and\\n\"ABCDEF\" and \"ASDFGH\".\\'\\n\\n`Did that already.\\' Electron had already put together a list of other\\ncommon passwords, such as the `words\\' made when a user typed the six\\nletters in the first alphabet row on a keyboard.\\n\\nPhoenix started on the list again. `OK the COs. Commend, Comment,\\nCommerce, Commercial, Commercialism, Commercially. Kill those last\\nthree.\\'\\n\\n`Huh? Why kill Commercial?\\'\\n\\n`Let\\'s just kill all the words with more than eight characters,\\'\\nPhoenix said.\\n\\n`No. That\\'s not a good idea.\\'\\n\\n`How come? The computer\\'s only going to read the first eight\\ncharacters and encrypt those. So we should kill all the rest.\\'\\n\\nSometimes Phoenix just didn\\'t get it. But Electron didn\\'t rub it in.\\nHe kept it low-key, so as not to bruise Phoenix\\'s ego. Often Electron\\nsensed Phoenix sought approval from the older hacker, but it was a\\nsubtle, perhaps even unconscious search.\\n\\n`Nah,\\' Electron began, `See, someone might use the whole word,\\nCommerce or Commercial. The first eight letters of these words are not\\nthe same. The eighth character in Commerce is \"e\", but in Commercial\\nit\\'s \"i\".\\'\\n\\nThere was a short silence.\\n\\n`Yeah,\\' Electron went on, `but you could kill all the words\\nlike Commercially, and Commercialism, that come after Commercial.\\nSee?\\'\\n\\n`Yeah. OK. I see,\\' Phoenix said.\\n\\n`But don\\'t just kill every word longer than eight characters,\\'\\nElectron added.\\n\\n`Hmm. OK. Yeah, all right.\\' Phoenix seemed a bit out of sorts. `Hey,\\'\\nhe brightened a bit, `it\\'s been a whole ten minutes since my machine\\ncrashed.\\'\\n\\n`Yeah?\\' Electron tried to sound interested.\\n\\n`Yeah. You know,\\' Phoenix changed the subject to his favourite topic,\\n`what we really need is Deszip. Gotta get that.\\' Deszip was a computer\\nprogram which could be used for password cracking.\\n\\n`And Zardoz. We need Zardoz,\\' Electron added. Zardoz was a restricted\\nelectronic publication detailing computer security holes.\\n\\n`Yeah. Gotta try to get into Spaf\\'s machine. Spaf\\'ll have it for\\nsure.\\' Eugene Spafford, Associate Professor of Computer Science at\\nPurdue University in the US, was one of the best known computer\\nsecurity experts on the Internet in 1990.\\n\\n`Yeah.\\'\\n\\nAnd so began their hunt for the holy grail.\\n\\n\\nDeszip and Zardoz glittered side by side as the most coveted prizes in\\nthe world of the international Unix hacker.\\n\\nCracking passwords took time and computer resources. Even a moderately\\npowerful university machine would grunt and groan under the weight of\\nthe calculations if it was asked to do. But the Deszip program could\\nchange that, lifting the load until it was, by comparison,\\nfeather-light. It worked at breathtaking speed and a hacker using\\nDeszip could crack encrypted passwords up to 25 times faster.\\n\\nZardoz, a worldwide security mailing list, was also precious, but for\\na different reason. Although the mailing list\\'s formal name was\\nSecurity Digest, everyone in the underground simply called it Zardoz,\\nafter the computer from which the mailouts originated. Zardoz also\\nhappened to be the name of a science fiction cult film starring Sean\\nConnery. Run by Neil Gorsuch, the Zardoz mailing list contained\\narticles, or postings, from various members of the computer security\\nindustry. The postings discussed newly discovered bugs--problems with\\na computer system which could be exploited to break into or gain root\\naccess on a machine. The beauty of the bugs outlined in Zardoz was\\nthat they worked on any computer system using the programs or\\noperating systems it described. Any university, any military system,\\nany research institute which ran the software documented in Zardoz was\\nvulnerable. Zardoz was a giant key ring, full of pass keys made to fit\\nvirtually every lock.\\n\\nTrue, system administrators who read a particular Zardoz posting might\\ntake steps to close up that security hole. But as the hacking\\ncommunity knew well, it was a long time between a Zardoz posting and a\\nshortage of systems with that hole. Often a bug worked on many\\ncomputers for months--sometimes years--after being announced on\\nZardoz.\\n\\nWhy? Many admins had never heard of the bug when it was first\\nannounced. Zardoz was an exclusive club, and most admins simply\\nweren\\'t members. You couldn\\'t just walk in off the street and sign up\\nfor Zardoz. You had to be vetted by peers in the computer security\\nindustry. You had to administer a legitimate computer system,\\npreferably with a large institution such as a university or a research\\nbody such as CSIRO. Figuratively speaking, the established members of\\nthe Zardoz mailing list peered down their noses at you and determined\\nif you were worthy of inclusion in Club Zardoz. Only they decided if\\nyou were trustworthy enough to share in the great security secrets of\\nthe world\\'s computer systems.\\n\\nIn 1989, the white hats, as hackers called the professional security\\ngurus, were highly paranoid about Zardoz getting into the wrong hands.\\nSo much so, in fact, that many postings to Zardoz were fine examples\\nof the art of obliqueness. A computer security expert would hint at a\\nnew bug in his posting without actually coming out and explaining it\\nin what is commonly referred to as a `cookbook\\' explanation.\\n\\nThis led to a raging debate within the comp-sec industry. In one\\ncorner, the cookbook purists said that bulletins such as Zardoz were\\nonly going to be helpful if people were frank with each other. They\\nwanted people posting to Zardoz to provide detailed, step-by-step\\nexplanations on how to exploit a particular security hole. Hackers\\nwould always find out about bugs one way or another and the best way\\nto keep them out of your system was to secure it properly in the first\\nplace. They wanted full disclosure.\\n\\nIn the other corner, the hard-line, command-and-control computer\\nsecurity types argued that posting an announcement to Zardoz posed the\\ngravest of security risks. What if Zardoz fell into the wrong hands?\\nWhy, any sixteen-year-old hacker would have step-by-step directions\\nshowing how to break into thousands of individual computers! If you\\nhad to reveal a security flaw--and the jury was still out in their\\nminds as to whether that was such a good idea--it should be done only\\nin the most oblique terms.\\n\\nWhat the hard-liners failed to understand was that world-class hackers\\nlike Electron could read the most oblique, carefully crafted Zardoz\\npostings and, within a matter of days if not hours, work out exactly\\nhow to exploit the security hole hinted at in the text. After which\\nthey could just as easily have written a cookbook version of the\\nsecurity bug.\\n\\nMost good hackers had come across one or two issues of Zardoz in their\\ntravels, often while rummaging though the system administrator\\'s mail\\non a prestigious institution\\'s computer. But no-one from the elite of\\nthe Altos underground had a full archive of all the back issues. The\\nhacker who possessed that would have details of every major security\\nhole discovered by the world\\'s best computer security minds since at\\nleast 1988.\\n\\nLike Zardoz, Deszip was well guarded. It was written by computer\\nsecurity expert Dr Matthew Bishop, who worked at NASA\\'s Research\\nInstitute for Advanced Computer Science before taking up a teaching\\nposition at Dartmouth, an Ivy League college in New Hampshire. The\\nUnited States government deemed Deszip\\'s very fast encryption\\nalgorithms to be so important, they were classified as armaments. It\\nwas illegal to export them from the US.\\n\\nOf course, few hackers in 1990 had the sophistication to use weapons\\nsuch as Zardoz and Deszip properly. Indeed, few even knew they\\nexisted. But Electron and Phoenix knew, along with a tiny handful of\\nothers, including Pad and Gandalf from Britain. Congregating on Altos\\nin Germany, they worked with a select group of others carefully\\ntargeting sites likely to contain parts of their holy grail. They were\\nmethodical and highly strategic, piecing information together with\\nexquisite, almost forensic, skill. While the common rabble of other\\nhackers were thumping their heads against walls in brute-force attacks\\non random machines, these hackers spent their time hunting for\\nstrategic pressure points--the Achilles\\' heels of the computer\\nsecurity community.\\n\\nThey had developed an informal hit list of machines, most of which\\nbelonged to high-level computer security gurus. Finding one or two\\nearly issues of Zardoz, Electron had combed through their postings\\nlooking not just on the surface--for the security bugs--but also\\npaying careful attention to the names and addresses of the people\\nwriting articles. Authors who appeared frequently in Zardoz, or had\\nsomething intelligent to say, went on the hit list. It was those\\npeople who were most likely to keep copies of Deszip or an archive of\\nZardoz on their machines.\\n\\nElectron had searched across the world for information about Deszip\\nand DES (Data Encryption Standard), the original encryption program\\nlater used in Deszip. He hunted through computers at the University of\\nNew York, the US Naval Research Laboratories in Washington DC,\\nHelsinki University of Technology, Rutgers University in New Jersey,\\nMelbourne University and Tampere University in Finland, but the search\\nbore little fruit. He found a copy of CDES, a public domain encryption\\nprogram which used the DES algorithm, but not Deszip. CDES could be\\nused to encrypt files but not to crack passwords.\\n\\nThe two Australian hackers had, however, enjoyed a small taste of\\nDeszip. In 1989 they had broken into a computer at Dartmouth College\\ncalled Bear. They discovered Deszip carefully tucked away in a corner\\nof Bear and had spirited a copy of the program away to a safer machine\\nat another institution.\\n\\nIt turned out to be a hollow victory. That copy of Deszip had been\\nencrypted with Crypt, a program based on the German Enigma machine\\nused in World War II. Without the passphrase--the key to unlock the\\nencryption--it was impossible to read Deszip. All they could do was\\nstare, frustrated, at the file name Deszip labelling a treasure just\\nout of reach.\\n\\nUndaunted, the hackers decided to keep the encrypted file just in case\\nthey ever came across the passphrase somewhere--in an email letter,\\nfor example--in one of the dozens of new computers they now hacked\\nregularly. Relabelling the encrypted Deszip file with a more innocuous\\nname, they stored the copy in a dark corner of another machine.\\nThinking it wise to buy a little insurance as well, they gave a second\\ncopy of the encrypted Deszip to Gandalf, who stored it on a machine in\\nthe UK in case the Australians\\' copy disappeared unexpectedly.\\n\\n\\nIn January 1990, Electron turned his attention to getting Zardoz.\\nAfter carefully reviewing an old copy of Zardoz, he had discovered a\\nsystem admin in Melbourne on the list. The subscriber could well have\\nthe entire Zardoz archive on his machine, and that machine was so\\nclose--less than half an hour\\'s drive from Electron\\'s home. All\\nElectron had to do was to break into the CSIRO.\\n\\nThe Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, or\\nCSIRO, is a government owned and operated research body with many\\noffices around Australia. Electron only wanted to get into one: the\\nDivision of Information Technology at 55 Barry Street, Carlton, just\\naround the corner from the University of Melbourne.\\n\\nRummaging through a Melbourne University computer, Electron had\\nalready found one copy of the Zardoz archive, belonging to a system\\nadmin. He gathered it up and quietly began downloading it to his\\ncomputer, but as his machine slowly siphoned off the Zardoz copy, his\\nlink to the university abruptly went dead. The admin had discovered\\nthe hacker and quickly killed the connection. All of which left\\nElectron back at square one--until he found another copy of Zardoz on\\nthe CSIRO machine.\\n\\nIt was nearly 3 a.m. on 1 February 1990, but Electron wasn\\'t tired.\\nHis head was buzzing. He had just successfully penetrated an account\\ncalled Worsley on the CSIRO computer called\\nDITMELA, using the sendmail bug. Electron assumed\\nDITMELA stood for Division of Information Technology, Melbourne,\\ncomputer `A\\'.\\n\\nElectron began sifting through Andrew Worsley\\'s directories that day.\\nHe knew Zardoz was in there somewhere, since he had seen it before.\\nAfter probing the computer, experimenting with different security\\nholes hoping one would let him inside, Electron managed to slip in\\nunnoticed. It was mid-afternoon, a bad time to hack a computer since\\nsomeone at work would likely spot the intruder before long. So\\nElectron told himself this was just a reconnaissance mission. Find out\\nif Zardoz was on the machine, then get out of there fast and come back\\nlater--preferably in the middle of the night--to pull Zardoz out.\\n\\nWhen he found a complete collection of Zardoz in Worsley\\'s directory,\\nElectron was tempted to try a grab and run. The problem was that, with\\nhis slow modem, he couldn\\'t run very quickly. Downloading Zardoz would\\ntake several hours. Quashing his overwhelming desire to reach out and\\ngrab Zardoz then and there, he slipped out of the machine noiselessly.\\n\\nEarly next morning, an excited and impatient Electron crept back into\\nDITMELA and headed straight for Worsley\\'s directory. Zardoz was still\\nthere. And a sweet irony. Electron was using a security bug he had\\nfound on an early issue of Zardoz to break into the computer which\\nwould surrender the entire archive to him.\\n\\nGetting Zardoz out of the CSIRO machine was going to be a little\\ndifficult. It was a big archive and at 300 baud--30 characters per\\nsecond--Electron\\'s modem would take five hours to siphon off an entire\\ncopy. Using the CAT command, Electron made copies of all the Zardoz\\nissues and bundled them up into one 500 k file. He called the new file\\n.t and stored it in the temporary directory on DITMELA.\\n\\nThen he considered what to do next. He would mail the Zardoz bundle to\\nanother account outside the CSIRO computer, for safe-keeping. But\\nafter that he had to make a choice: try to download the thing himself\\nor hang up, call Phoenix and ask him to download it.\\n\\nUsing his 2400 baud modem, Phoenix would be able to download the\\nZardoz bundle eight times faster than Electron could. On the other\\nhand, Electron didn\\'t particularly want to give Phoenix access to the\\nCSIRO machine. They had both been targeting the machine, but he hadn\\'t\\ntold Phoenix that he had actually managed to get in. It wasn\\'t that he\\nplanned on withholding Zardoz when he got it. Quite the contrary,\\nElectron wanted Phoenix to read the security file so they could bounce\\nideas off each other. When it came to accounts, however, Phoenix had a\\nway of messing things up. He talked too much. He was simply not\\ndiscreet.\\n\\nWhile Electron considered his decision, his fingers kept working at\\nthe keyboard. He typed quickly, mailing copies of the Zardoz bundle to\\ntwo hacked student accounts at Melbourne University. With the\\npasswords to both accounts, he could get in whenever he wanted and he\\nwasn\\'t taking any chances with this precious cargo. Two accounts were\\nsafer than one--a main account and a back-up in case someone changed\\nthe password on the first one.\\n\\nThen, as the DITMELA machine was still in the process of mailing the\\nZardoz bundle off to the back-up sites, Electron\\'s connection suddenly\\ndied.\\n\\nThe CSIRO machine had hung up on him, which probably meant one thing.\\nThe admin had logged him off. Electron was furious. What the hell was\\na system administrator doing on a computer at this hour? The admin was\\nsupposed to be asleep! That\\'s why Electron logged on when he did. He\\nhad seen Zardoz on the CSIRO machine the day before but he had been so\\npatient refusing to touch it because the risk of discovery was too\\ngreat. And now this.\\n\\nThe only hope was to call Phoenix and get him to login to the\\nMelbourne Uni accounts to see if the mail had arrived safely. If so,\\nhe could download it with his faster modem before the CSIRO admin had\\ntime to warn the Melbourne Uni admin, who would change the passwords.\\n\\nElectron got on the phone to Phoenix. They had long since stopped\\ncaring about what time of day they rang each other. 10 p.m. 2 a.m.\\n4.15 a.m. 6.45 a.m.\\n\\n`Yeah.\\' Electron greeted Phoenix in the usual way.\\n\\n`Yup,\\' Phoenix responded.\\n\\nElectron told Phoenix what happened and gave him the two accounts at\\nMelbourne University where he had mailed the Zardoz bundle.\\n\\nPhoenix hung up and rang back a few minutes later. Both accounts were\\ndead. Someone from Melbourne University had gone in and changed the\\npasswords within 30 minutes of Electron being booted off the CSIRO\\ncomputer. Both hackers were disturbed by the implications of this\\nevent. It meant someone--in fact probably several people--were onto\\nthem. But their desperation to get Zardoz overcame their fear.\\n\\nElectron had one more account on the CSIRO computer. He didn\\'t want to\\ngive it to Phoenix, but he didn\\'t have a choice. Still, the whole\\nventure was filled with uncertainty. Who knew if the Zardoz bundle was\\nstill there? Surely an admin who bothered to kick Electron out would\\nmove Zardoz to somewhere inaccessible. There was, however, a single\\nchance.\\n\\nWhen Electron read off the password and username, he told Phoenix to\\ncopy the Zardoz bundle to a few other machines on the Internet instead\\nof trying to download it to his own computer. It would be much\\nquicker, and the CSIRO admin wouldn\\'t dare break into someone else\\'s\\ncomputers to delete the copied file. Choosing overseas sites would\\nmake it even harder for the admin to reach the admins of those\\nmachines and warn them in time. Then, once Zardoz was safely tucked\\naway in a few back-up sites, Phoenix could download it over the\\nInternet from one of those with less risk of being booted off the\\nmachine halfway through the process.\\n\\nSitting at his home in Kelvin Grove, Thornbury, just two suburbs north\\nof the CSIRO machine, Ian Mathieson watched the hacker break into his\\ncomputer again. Awoken by a phone call at 2.30 a.m. telling him there\\nwas a suspected hacker in his computer, Mathieson immediately logged\\nin to his work system, DITMELA, via his home computer and modem. The\\ncall, from David Hornsby of the Melbourne University Computer Science\\nDepartment, was no false alarm.\\n\\nAfter watching the unknown hacker, who had logged in through a\\nMelbourne University machine terminal server, for about twenty\\nminutes, Mathieson booted the hacker off his system. Afterwards he\\nnoticed that the DITMELA computer was still trying to execute a\\ncommand issued by the hacker. He looked a little closer, and\\ndiscovered DITMELA was trying to deliver mail to two Melbourne\\nUniversity accounts.\\n\\nThe mail, however, hadn\\'t been completely delivered. It was still\\nsitting in the mail spool, a temporary holding pen for undelivered\\nmail. Curious as to what the hacker would want so much from his\\nsystem, Mathieson moved the file into a subdirectory to look at it. He\\nwas horrified to find the entire Zardoz archive, and he knew exactly\\nwhat it meant. These were no ordinary hackers--they were precision\\nfliers. Fortunately, Mathieson\\nconsoled himself, he had stopped the mail before it had been sent out\\nand secured it.\\n\\nUnfortunately, however, Mathieson had missed Electron\\'s original\\nfile--the bundle of Zardoz copies. When Electron had mailed the file,\\nhe had copied it, leaving the original intact. They were still sitting\\non DITMELA under the unassuming name .t. Mailing a file didn\\'t delete\\nit--the computer only sent a copy of the original. Mathieson was an\\nintelligent man, a medical doctor with a master\\'s degree in computer\\nscience, but he had forgotten to check the temporary directory, one of\\nthe few places a hacker could store files on a Unix system if he\\ndidn\\'t have root privileges.\\n\\nAt exactly 3.30 a.m. Phoenix logged into DITMELA from the University\\nof Texas. He quickly looked in the temporary directory. The .t file\\nwas there, just as Electron had said it would be. The hacker quickly\\nbegan transferring it back to the University of Texas.\\n\\nHe was feeling good. It looked like the Australians were going to get\\nthe entire Zardoz collection after all. Everything was going extremely\\nwell--until the transfer suddenly died. Phoenix had forgotten to check\\nthat there was enough disk space available on the University of Texas\\naccount to download the sizeable Zardoz bundle. Now, as he was logged\\ninto a very hot machine, a machine where the admin could well be\\nwatching his every move, he discovered there wasn\\'t enough room for\\nthe Zardoz file.\\n\\nAware that every second spent on-line to DITMELA posed a serious risk,\\nPhoenix logged off the CSIRO machine immediately. Still connected to\\nthe Texas computer, he fiddled around with it, deleting other files\\nand making enough room to pull the whole 500 k Zardoz file across.\\n\\nAt 3.37 a.m. Phoenix entered DITMELA again. This time, he vowed,\\nnothing would go wrong. He started up the file transfer and waited.\\nLess than ten minutes later, he logged off the CSIRO computer and\\nnervously checked the University of Texas system. It was there.\\nZardoz, in all its glory. And it was his! Phoenix was ecstatic.\\n\\nHe wasn\\'t done yet and there was no time for complacency. Swiftly, he\\nbegan compressing and encrypting Zardoz. He\\ncompressed it because a smaller file was less obvious on the Texas\\nmachine and was faster to send to a back-up machine. He encrypted it\\nso no-one nosing around the file would be able to see what was in it.\\nHe wasn\\'t just worried about system admins; the Texas system was\\nriddled with hackers, in part because it was home to his friend,\\nLegion of Doom hacker Erik Bloodaxe, a\\nstudent at the university.\\n\\nAfter Phoenix was satisfied Zardoz was safe, he rang Electron just\\nbefore 4 a.m. with the good news. By 8.15, Phoenix had downloaded\\nZardoz from the Texas computer onto his own machine. By 1.15 p.m.,\\nElectron had downloaded it from Phoenix\\'s machine to his own.\\n\\n\\nZardoz had been a difficult conquest, but Deszip would prove to be\\neven more so. While dozens of security experts possessed complete\\nZardoz archives, far fewer people had Deszip. And, at least\\nofficially, all of them were in the US.\\n\\nThe US government banned the export of cryptography algorithms. To\\nsend a copy of Deszip, or DES or indeed any other encryption program\\noutside the US was a crime. It was illegal because the US State\\nDepartment\\'s Office of Defense Trade Controls considered any\\nencryption program to be a weapon. ITAR, the International Traffic in\\nArms Regulations stemming from the US Arms Export Control Act 1977,\\nrestricted publication of and trad in `defense articles\\'. It didn\\'t\\nmatter whether you flew to Europe with a disk in your pocket, or you\\nsent the material over the Internet. If you violated ITAR, you faced\\nthe prospect of prison.\\n\\nOccasionally, American computer programmers discreetly slipped copies\\nof encryption programs to specialists in their field outside the US.\\nOnce the program was outside the US, it was fair game--there was\\nnothing US authorities could do about someone in Norway sending Deszip\\nto a colleague in Australia. But even so, the comp-sec and\\ncryptography communities outside the US still held programs such as\\nDeszip very tightly within their own inner sanctums.\\n\\nAll of which meant that Electron and Phoenix would almost certainly\\nhave to target a site in the US. Electron continued to compile a hit\\nlist, based on the Zardoz mailing list, which he gave to Phoenix. The\\ntwo hackers then began searching the growing Internet for computers\\nbelonging to the targets.\\n\\nIt was an impressive hit list. Matthew Bishop, author of Deszip.\\nRussell Brand, of the Lawrence Livermore National Labs, a research\\nlaboratory funded by the US Department of Energy. Dan Farmer, an\\nauthor of the computer program COPS, a popular security-testing\\nprogram which included a password cracking program. There were others.\\nAnd, at the top of the list, Eugene Spafford, or Spaf, as the hackers\\ncalled him.\\n\\nBy 1990, the computer underground viewed Spaf not just as security\\nguru, but also as an anti-hacker zealot. Spaf was based at Purdue\\nUniversity, a hotbed of computer security experts. Bishop had earned\\nhis PhD at Purdue and Dan Farmer was still there. Spaf was also one of\\nthe founders of usenet, the Internet newsgroups service. While working\\nas a computer scientist at the university, he had made a name for\\nhimself by, among other things, writing a technical analysis of the\\nRTM worm. The worm, authored by Cornell University student Robert T.\\nMorris Jr in 1988, proved to be a boon for Spaf\\'s career.\\n\\nPrior to the RTM worm, Spaf had been working in software engineering.\\nAfter the worm, he became a computer ethicist and a very public\\nspokesman for the conservatives in the computer security industry.\\nSpaf went on tour across the US, lecturing the public and the media on\\nworms, viruses and the ethics of hacking. During the Morris case,\\nhacking became a hot topic in the United States, and Spaf fed the\\nflames. When Judge Howard G. Munson refused to sentence Morris to\\nprison, instead ordering him to complete 400 hours community service,\\npay a $10000 fine and submit to three years probation, Spaf publicly\\nrailed against the decision. The media reported that he had called on\\nthe computer industry to boycott any company which chose to employ\\nRobert T. Morris Jr.\\n\\nTargeting Spaf therefore served a dual purpose for the Australian\\nhackers. He was undoubtedly a repository of treasures such as Deszip,\\nand he was also a tall poppy.\\n\\nOne night, Electron and Phoenix decided to break into Spaf\\'s machine\\nat Purdue to steal a copy of Deszip. Phoenix would do the actual\\nhacking, since he had the fast modem, but he would talk to Electron\\nsimultaneously on the other phone line. Electron would guide him at\\neach step. That way, when Phoenix hit a snag, he wouldn\\'t have to\\nretreat to regroup and risk discovery.\\n\\nBoth hackers had managed to break into another computer at Purdue,\\ncalled Medusa. But Spaf had a separate machine, Uther, which was\\nconnected to Medusa.\\n\\nPhoenix poked and prodded at Uther, trying to open a hole wide enough\\nfor him to crawl through. At Electron\\'s suggestion, he tried to use\\nthe CHFN bug. The CHFN command lets users change the information\\nprovided--such as their name, work address or office phone\\nnumber--when someone `fingers\\' their accounts. The bug had appeared in\\none of the Zardoz files and Phoenix and Electron had already used it\\nto break into several other machines.\\n\\nElectron wanted to use the CHFN bug because, if the attack was\\nsuccessful, Phoenix would be able to make a root account for himself\\non Spaf\\'s machine. That would be the ultimate slap in the face to a\\nhigh-profile computer security guru.\\n\\nBut things weren\\'t going well for Phoenix. The frustrated Australian\\nhacker kept telling Electron that the bug should work, but it\\nwouldn\\'t, and he couldn\\'t figure out why. The problem, Electron\\nfinally concluded, was that Spaf\\'s machine was a Sequent. The CHFN bug\\ndepended on a particular Unix password file structure, but Sequents\\nused a different structure. It didn\\'t help that Phoenix didn\\'t know\\nthat much about Sequents--they were one of Gandalf\\'s specialties.\\n\\nAfter a few exasperating hours struggling to make the CHFN bug work,\\nPhoenix gave up and turned to another security flaw suggested by\\nElectron: the FTP bug. Phoenix ran through the bug in his mind.\\nNormally, someone used FTP, or file transfer protocol, to transfer\\nfiles over a network, such as the Internet, from one computer to\\nanother. FTPing to another machine was a bit like telnetting, but the\\nuser didn\\'t need a password to login and the commands he could execute\\nonce in the other computer were usually very limited.\\n\\nIf it worked, the FTP bug would allow Phoenix to slip in an extra\\ncommand during the FTP login process. That command would force Spaf\\'s\\nmachine to allow Phoenix to login as anyone he wanted--and what he\\nwanted was to login as someone who had root privileges. The `root\\'\\naccount might be a little obvious\\nif anyone was watching, and it didn\\'t always have remote\\naccess anyway. So he chose `daemon\\', another commonly root-privileged\\naccount, instead.\\n\\nIt was a shot in the dark. Phoenix was fairly sure Spaf would have\\nsecured his machine against such an obvious attack, but Electron urged\\nhim to give it a try anyway. The FTP bug had been announced throughout\\nthe computer security community long ago, appearing in an early issue\\nof Zardoz. Phoenix hesitated, but he had run out of ideas, and time.\\n\\nPhoenix typed:\\n\\nFTP -i uther.purdue.edu\\n\\nquote user anonymous\\n\\nquote cd ~daemon\\n\\nquote pass anything\\n\\nThe few seconds it took for his commands to course from his suburban\\nhome in Melbourne and race deep into the Midwest felt like a lifetime.\\nHe wanted Spaf\\'s machine, wanted Deszip, and wanted this attack to\\nwork. If he could just get Deszip, he felt the Australians would be\\nunstoppable.\\n\\nSpaf\\'s machine opened its door as politely as a doorman at the Ritz\\nCarlton. Phoenix smiled at his computer. He was in.\\n\\nIt was like being in Aladdin\\'s cave. Phoenix just sat there, stunned\\nat the bounty which lay before him. It was his, all his. Spaf had\\nmegabytes of security files in his directories. Source code for the\\nRTM Internet worm. Source code for the W**K worm. Everything. Phoenix\\nwanted to plunge his hands in each treasure chest and scoop out greedy\\nhandfuls, but he resisted the urge. He had a more important--a more\\nstrategic--mission to accomplish first.\\n\\nHe prowled through the directories, hunting everywhere for Deszip.\\nLike a burglar scouring the house for the family silver, he pawed\\nthrough directory after directory. Surely, Spaf had to have Deszip. If\\nanyone besides Matthew Bishop was going to have a copy, he would. And\\nfinally, there it was. Deszip. Just waiting for Phoenix.\\n\\nThen Phoenix noticed something else. Another file. Curiosity got the\\nbetter of him and he zoomed in to have a quick look. This one\\ncontained a passphrase--the passphrase. The phrase the Australians\\nneeded to decrypt the original copy of Deszip they had stolen from the\\nBear computer at Dartmouth three months earlier. Phoenix couldn\\'t\\nbelieve the passphrase. It was so simple, so obvious. But he caught\\nhimself. This was no time to cry over spilled milk. He had to get\\nDeszip out of the machine quickly, before anyone noticed he was there.\\n\\nBut as Phoenix began typing in commands, his screen appeared to freeze\\nup. He checked. It wasn\\'t his computer. Something was wrong at the\\nother end. He was still logged into Spaf\\'s machine. The connection\\nhadn\\'t been killed. But when he typed commands, the computer in West\\nLafayette, Indiana, didn\\'t respond. Spaf\\'s machine just sat there,\\ndeaf and dumb.\\n\\nPhoenix stared at his computer, trying to figure out what was\\nhappening. Why wouldn\\'t Spaf\\'s machine answer? There were two\\npossibilities. Either the network--the connection between the first\\nmachine he penetrated at Purdue and Spaf\\'s own machine--had gone down\\naccidentally. Or someone had pulled the plug.\\n\\nWhy pull the plug? If they knew he was in there, why not just kick him\\nout of the machine? Better still, why not kick him out of Purdue all\\ntogether? Maybe they wanted to keep him on-line to trace which machine\\nhe was coming from, eventually winding backwards from system to\\nsystem, following his trail.\\n\\nPhoenix was in a dilemma. If the connection had crashed by accident,\\nhe wanted to stay put and wait for the network to come back up again.\\nThe FTP hole in Spaf\\'s machine was an incredible piece of luck.\\nChances were that someone would find\\nevidence of his break-in after he left and plug it. On the\\nother hand, he didn\\'t want the people at Purdue tracing his\\nconnections.\\n\\nHe waited a few more minutes, trying to hedge his bets. Feeling nervy\\nas the extended silence emanating from Spaf\\'s machine wore on, Phoenix\\ndecided to jump. With the lost treasures of Aladdin\\'s cave fading in\\nhis mind\\'s eye like a mirage, Phoenix killed his connection.\\n\\nElectron and Phoenix talked on the phone, moodily contemplating their\\nlosses. It was a blow, but Electron reminded himself that getting\\nDeszip was never going to be easy. At least they had the passphrase to\\nunlock the encrypted Deszip taken from Dartmouth.\\n\\nSoon, however, they discovered a problem. There had to be one,\\nElectron thought. They couldn\\'t just have something go off without a\\nhitch for a change. That would be too easy. The problem this time was\\nthat when they went searching for their copy from Dartmouth, which had\\nbeen stored several months before, it had vanished. The Dartmouth\\nsystem admin must have deleted it.\\n\\nIt was maddening. The frustration was unbearable. Each time they had\\nDeszip just within their grasp, it slipped away and\\ndisappeared. Yet each time they lost their grip, it only deepened\\ntheir desire to capture the elusive prize. Deszip was fast becoming an\\nall-consuming obsession for Phoenix and Electron.\\n\\nTheir one last hope was the second copy of the encrypted Dartmouth\\nDeszip file they had given to Gandalf, but that hope did not burn\\nbrightly. After all, if the Australians\\' copy had been deleted, there\\nwas every likelihood that the Brit\\'s copy had suffered the same fate.\\nGandalf\\'s copy hadn\\'t been stored on his own computer. He had put it\\non some dark corner of a machine in Britain.\\n\\nElectron and Phoenix logged onto Altos and waited for Pad or Gandalf\\nto show up.\\n\\nPhoenix typed .s for a list of who was on-line. He saw that Pad was\\nlogged on:\\n\\nNo Chan User\\n\\n0 Guest\\n\\n1 Phoenix\\n\\n2 Pad\\n\\nGuest 0 was Electron. He usually logged on as Guest, partly because he\\nwas so paranoid about being busted and because he believed operators\\nmonitored his connections if they knew it was Electron logging in.\\nThey seemed to take great joy in sniffing the password to his own\\naccount on Altos. Then, when he had logged off, they logged in and\\nchanged his password so he couldn\\'t get back under the name Electron.\\nNothing was more annoying. Phoenix typed, `Hey, Pad. How\\'s it going?\\'\\n\\nPad wrote back, `Feeny! Heya.\\'\\n\\n`Do you and Gand still have that encrypted copy of Deszip we gave you\\na few months ago?\\'\\n\\n`Encrypted copy ... hmm. Thinking.\\' Pad paused. He and Gandalf hacked\\ndozens of computer systems regularly. Sometimes it was difficult to\\nrecall just where they had stored things.\\n\\n`Yeah, I know what you mean. I don\\'t know. It was on a system on\\nJANET,\\' Pad said. Britain\\'s Joint Academic Network was the equivalent\\nof Australia\\'s AARNET, an early Internet based largely on a backbone\\nof universities and research centres.\\n\\n`I can\\'t remember which system it was on,\\' Pad continued.\\n\\nIf the Brits couldn\\'t recall the institution, let alone the machine\\nwhere they had hidden Deszip, it was time to give up\\nall hope. JANET comprised hundreds, maybe thousands, of machines. It\\nwas far too big a place to randomly hunt around for a file which\\nGandalf would no doubt have tried to disguise in the first place.\\n\\n`But the file was encrypted, and you didn\\'t have the password,\\' Pad\\nwrote. `How come you want it?\\'\\n\\n`Because we found the password. <smile>\\' That was the\\netiquette on Altos. If you wanted to suggest an action, you put it in\\n< >.\\n\\n`Gr8!\\' Pad answered.\\n\\nThat was Pad and Gandalf\\'s on-line style. The number eight was the\\nBritish hackers\\' hallmark, since their group was called 8lgm, and they\\nused it instead of letters. Words like `great\\', `mate\\' and `later\\'\\nbecame `gr8\\', `m8\\' and `l8r\\'.\\n\\nWhen people logged into Altos they could name a `place\\' of origin for\\nothers to see. Of course, if you were logging from a country which had\\nlaws against hacking, you wouldn\\'t give your real country. You\\'d just\\npick a place at random. Some people logged in from places like\\nArgentina, or Israel. Pad and Gandalf logged in from 8lgm.\\n\\n`I\\'ll try to find Gandalf and ask him if he knows where we stashed the\\ncopy,\\' Pad wrote to Phoenix.\\n\\n`Good. Thanks.\\'\\n\\nWhile Phoenix and Electron waited on-line for Pad to return, Par\\nshowed up on-line and joined their conversation. Par didn\\'t know who\\nGuest 0 was, but Guest certainly knew who Par was. Time hadn\\'t healed\\nElectron\\'s old wounds when it came to Par. Electron didn\\'t really\\nadmit to himself the bad blood was still there over Theorem. He told\\nhimself that he couldn\\'t be bothered with Par, that Par was just a\\nphreaker, not a real hacker, that Par was lame.\\n\\nPhoenix typed, `Hey, Par. How\\'s it going?\\'\\n\\n`Feenster!\\' Par replied. `What\\'s happening?\\'\\n\\n`Lots and lots.\\'\\n\\nPar turned his attention to the mystery Guest 0. He didn\\'t want to\\ndiscuss private things with someone who might be a security guy\\nhanging around the chat channel like a bad smell.\\n\\n`Guest, do you have a name?\\' Par asked.\\n\\n`Yeah. It\\'s \"Guest--#0\".\\'\\n\\n`You got any other names?\\'\\n\\nThere was a long pause.\\n\\nElectron typed, `I guess not.\\'\\n\\n`Any other names besides dickhead that is?\\'\\n\\nElectron sent a `whisper\\'--a private message--to Phoenix telling him\\nnot to tell Par his identity.\\n\\n`OK. Sure,\\' Phoenix whispered back. To show he would play along with\\nwhatever Electron had in mind, Phoenix added a sideways smiley face at\\nthe end: `:-)\\'.\\n\\nPar didn\\'t know Electron and Phoenix were whispering to each other. He\\nwas still waiting to find out the identity of Guest. `Well, speak up,\\nGuest. Figured out who you are yet?\\'\\n\\nElectron knew Par was on the run at the time. Indeed, Par had been on\\nthe run from the US Secret Service for more than six months by the\\nbeginning of 1990. He also knew Par was highly paranoid.\\n\\nElectron took aim and fired.\\n\\n`Hey, Par. You should eat more. You\\'re looking underFED these days.\\'\\n\\nPar was suddenly silent. Electron sat at his computer, quietly\\nlaughing to himself, halfway across the world from Par. Well, he\\nthought, that ought to freak out Par a bit. Nothing like a subtle hint\\nat law enforcement to drive him nuts.\\n\\n`Did you see THAT?\\' Par whispered to Phoenix. `UnderFED. What did he\\nmean?\\'\\n\\n`I dunno,\\' Phoenix whispered back. Then he forwarded a copy of Par\\'s\\nprivate message on to Electron. He knew it would make him laugh.\\n\\nPar was clearly worried. `Who the f**k are you?\\' he whispered to\\nElectron but Guest 0 didn\\'t answer.\\n\\nWith growing anxiety, Par whispered to Phoenix, `Who IS this guy? Do\\nyou know him?\\'\\n\\nPhoenix didn\\'t answer.\\n\\n`Because, well, it\\'s weird. Didn\\'t you see? FED was in caps. What the\\nf**k does that mean? Is he a fed? Is he trying to give me a message\\nfrom the feds?\\'\\n\\nSitting at his terminal, on the other side of Melbourne from Electron,\\nPhoenix was also laughing. He liked Par, but the American was an easy\\ntarget. Par had become so paranoid since he went on the run across the\\nUS, and Electron knew just the right buttons to push.\\n\\n`I don\\'t know,\\' Phoenix whispered to Par. `I\\'m sure he\\'s not really a\\nfed.\\'\\n\\n`Well, I am wondering about that comment,\\' Par whispered back.\\n`UnderFED. Hmm. Maybe he knows something. Maybe it\\'s some kind of\\nwarning. s**t, maybe the Secret Service knows where I am.\\'\\n\\n`You think?\\' Phoenix whispered to Par. `It might be a warning of some\\nkind?\\' It was too funny.\\n\\n`Can you check his originating NUA?\\' Par wanted to know what network\\naddress the mystery guest was coming from. It might give him a clue as\\nto the stranger\\'s identity.\\n\\nPhoenix could barely contain himself. He kept forwarding the private\\nmessages on to Electron. Par was clearly becoming more agitated.\\n\\n`I wish he would just tell me WHO he was,\\' Par whispered. `s**t. It is\\nvery f**king weird. UnderFED. It\\'s spinning me out.\\'\\n\\nThen Par logged off.\\n\\nElectron typed, `I guess Par had to go. <Grin>\\' Then, chuckling to\\nhimself, he waited for news on Gandalf\\'s Deszip copy.\\n\\nIf Pad and Gandalf hadn\\'t kept their copy of Deszip, the Australians\\nwould be back to square one, beginning with a hunt for a system which\\neven had Deszip. It was a daunting task and by the time Pad and\\nGandalf finally logged back into Altos, Phoenix and Electron had\\nbecome quite anxious.\\n\\n`How did you go?\\' Phoenix asked. `Do you still have Deszip?\\'\\n\\n`Well, at first I thought I had forgotten which system I left it on\\n...\\'\\n\\nElectron jumped in, `And then?\\'\\n\\n`Then I remembered.\\'\\n\\n`Good news?\\' Phoenix exclaimed.\\n\\n`Well, no. Not exactly,\\' Gandalf said. `The account is dead.\\'\\n\\nElectron felt like someone had thrown a bucket of cold water on him.\\n`Dead? Dead how?\\' he asked.\\n\\n`Dead like someone changed the password. Not sure why. I\\'ll have to\\nre-hack the system to get to the file.\\'\\n\\n`f**k, this Deszip is frustrating,\\' Electron wrote.\\n\\n`This is getting ridiculous,\\' Phoenix added.\\n\\n`I don\\'t even know if the copy is still in there,\\' Gandalf replied. `I\\nhid it, but who knows? Been a few months. Admins might have deleted\\nit.\\'\\n\\n`You want some help hacking the system again, Gand?\\' Phoenix asked.\\n\\n`Nah, It\\'ll be easy. It\\'s a Sequent. Just have to hang around until\\nthe ops go home.\\'\\n\\nIf an op was logged on and saw Gandalf hunting around, he or she might\\nkick Gandalf off and investigate the file which so interested the\\nhacker. Then they would lose Deszip all over again.\\n\\n`I hope we get it,\\' Pad chipped in. `Would be gr8!\\'\\n\\n`Gr8 indeed. Feen, you\\'ve got the key to the encryption?\\' Gandalf\\nasked.\\n\\n`Yeah.\\'\\n\\n`How many characters is it?\\' It was Gandalf\\'s subtle way of asking for\\nthe key itself.\\n\\nPhoenix wasn\\'t sure what to do. He wanted to give the British hackers\\nthe key, but he was torn. He needed Pad and Gandalf\\'s help to get the\\ncopy of Deszip, if it was still around. But he knew Electron was\\nwatching the conversation, and Electron was always so paranoid. He\\ndisliked giving out any information, let alone giving it over Altos,\\nwhere the conversations were possibly logged by security people.\\n\\n`Should I give him the key?\\' Phoenix whispered to Electron.\\n\\nGandalf was waiting. To fend him off, Phoenix said, `It\\'s 9 chars.\\'\\nChars was short for characters. On Altos the rule was to abbreviate\\nwhere ever possible.\\n\\n`What is the first char?\\'\\n\\n`Yeah. Tell him,\\' Electron whispered to Phoenix.\\n\\n`Well, the key is ...\\'\\n\\n`You\\'re going to spew when you find out, Gand,\\' Electron interrupted.\\n\\n`Yes ... go on,\\' Gandalf said. `I am listening.\\'\\n\\n`You won\\'t believe it. <spew spew spew> The key is ... Dartmouth.\\'\\n\\n`WHAT???? WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\' Gandalf exclaimed.\\n`No!!! IT\\'s NOT TRUE! Bollox! You are KIDDING?\\'\\n\\nThe British hacker was thumping himself on the head. The name of the\\nfrigging university! What a stupid password!\\n\\nPhoenix gave an on-line chuckle. `Hehe. Yeah. So hard to guess. We\\ncould have had Deszip for all these months ...\\'\\n\\n`Jesus. I hope it\\'s still on that JANET system,\\' Gandalf said. Now\\nthat he actually had the password, finding the file became even more\\nurgent.\\n\\n`Pray. Pray. Pray,\\' Phoenix said. `Yeah, you should have seen the\\nlicence text on Deszip--it was by NASA.\\'\\n\\n`You\\'ve seen it? You saw Deszip\\'s source code?\\'\\n\\n`No,\\' Phoenix answered. `When I went back to the BEAR machine to check\\nif Deszip was still there, the program was gone. But the licence\\nagreement and other stuff was there. Should have read the licence ...\\ntruly amazing. It basically went on and on about how the people who\\nwrote it didn\\'t want people like us to get a hold of it. Hehe.\\'\\n\\nElectron was growing impatient. `Yeah. So, Gand, when you gonna go\\ncheck that JANET system?\\'\\n\\n`Now. Fingers crossed, m8! See ya l8r ...\\' Then he was gone.\\n\\nThe waiting was driving Electron nuts. He kept thinking about Deszip,\\nabout how he could have had it months and months ago. That program was\\nsuch a prize. He was salivating at the thought of getting it after all\\nthis time pursuing it around the globe, chasing its trail from system\\nto system, never quite getting close enough to grab it.\\n\\nWhen Gandalf showed up again, Pad, Phoenix and Electron were all over\\nhim in an instant.\\n\\n`WE f**kING GOT IT GUYS!!!!!\\' Gandalf exclaimed.\\n\\n`Good job m8!\\' Pad said.\\n\\n`YES!\\' Electron added. `Have you decrypted it yet?\\'\\n\\n`Not yet. Crypt isn\\'t on that machine. We can either copy Crypt onto\\nthat machine or copy the file onto another computer which already has\\nCrypt on it,\\' Gandalf said.\\n\\n`Let\\'s move it. Quick ... quick ... this damn thing has a habit of\\ndisappearing,\\' Electron said.\\n\\n`Yeah, this is the last copy ... the only one I got.\\'\\n\\n`OK. Think ... think ... where can we copy it to?\\' Electron said.\\n\\n`Texas!\\' Gandalf wanted to copy it to a computer at the University of\\nTexas at Austin, home of the LOD hacker Erik Bloodaxe.\\n\\nIrrepressible, Gandalf came on like a steam roller if he liked\\nyou--and cut you down in a flash if he didn\\'t. His rough-and-tumble\\nworking-class humour particularly appealed to Electron. Gandalf seemed\\nable to zero in on the things which worried you most--something so\\ndeep or serious it was often unsaid. Then he would blurt it out in\\nsuch crass, blunt terms you couldn\\'t help laughing. It was his way of\\nbeing in your face in the friendliest possible manner.\\n\\n`Yeah! Blame everything on Erik!\\' Phoenix joked. `No, seriously. That\\nplace is crawling with security now, all after Erik. They are into\\neverything.\\'\\n\\nPhoenix had heard all about the security purge at the university from\\nErik. The Australian called Erik all the time, mostly by charging the\\ncalls to stolen AT&T cards. Erik hadn\\'t been raided by the Secret\\nService yet, but he had been tipped off and was expecting a visit any\\nday.\\n\\n`It probably won\\'t decrypt anyway,\\' Electron said.\\n\\n`Oh, phuck off!\\' Gandalf shot back. `Come on! I need a site NOW!\\'\\n\\n`Thinking ...\\' Phoenix said. `Gotta be some place with room--how big\\nis it?\\'\\n\\n`It\\'s 900 k compressed--probably 3 meg when we uncompress it. Come on,\\nhurry up! How about a university?\\'\\n\\n`Princeton, Yale could do either of those.\\' Electron suggested. `What\\nabout MIT--you hacked an account there recently, Gand?\\'\\n\\n`No.\\'\\n\\nAll four hackers racked their minds for a safe haven. The world was\\ntheir oyster, as British and Australian hackers held a real-time\\nconversation in Germany about whether to hide their treasure in\\nAustin, Texas; Princeton, New Jersey; Boston, Massachusetts; or New\\nHaven, Connecticut.\\n\\n`We only need somewhere to stash it for a little while, until we can\\ndownload it,\\' Gandalf said. `Got to be some machine where we\\'ve got\\nroot. And it\\'s got to have anon FTP.\\'\\n\\nAnon FTP, or anonymous file transfer protocol, on a host machine would\\nallow Gandalf to shoot the file from his JANET machine across the\\nInternet into the host. Most importantly, Gandalf could do so without\\nan account on the target machine. He could simply login as\\n`anonymous\\', a method of access which had more limitations than simply\\nlogging in with a normal account. He would, however, still be able to\\nupload the file.\\n\\n`OK. OK, I have an idea,\\' Phoenix said. `Lemme go check\\nit out.\\'\\n\\nPhoenix dropped out of Altos and connected to the University of Texas.\\nThe physical location of a site didn\\'t matter. His head was spinning\\nand it was the only place he could think of. But he didn\\'t try to\\nconnect to Happy, the machine he often used which Erik had told him\\nabout. He headed to one of the other university computers, called\\nWalt.\\n\\nThe network was overloaded. Phoenix was left dangling, waiting to\\nconnect for minutes on end. The lines were congested. He logged back\\ninto Altos and told Pad and Electron. Gandalf was nowhere to be seen.\\n\\n`Damn,\\' Electron said. Then, `OK, I might have an idea.\\'\\n\\n`No, wait!\\' Phoenix cut in. `I just thought of a site! And I have root\\ntoo! But it\\'s on NASA ...\\'\\n\\n`Oh that\\'s OK. I\\'m sure they won\\'t mind a bit. <grin>\\'\\n\\n`I\\'ll go make sure it\\'s still OK. Back in a bit,\\' Phoenix typed.\\n\\nPhoenix jumped out of Altos and headed toward NASA. He telnetted into\\na NASA computer called CSAB at the Langley Research Center in Hampton,\\nVirginia. He had been in and out of NASA quite a few times and had\\nrecently made himself a root account on CSAB. First, he had to check\\nthe account was still alive, then he had to make sure the system\\nadministrator wasn\\'t logged in.\\n\\nWhizzing past the official warning sign about unauthorised access in\\nUS government computers on the login screen, Phoenix typed in his user\\nname and password.\\n\\nIt worked. He was in. And he had root privileges.\\n\\nHe quickly looked around on the system. The administrator was on-line.\\nDamn.\\n\\nPhoenix fled the NASA computer and sprinted back into Altos. Gandalf\\nwas there, along with the other two, waiting for him.\\n\\n`Well?\\' Electron asked.\\n\\n`OK. All right. The NASA machine will work. It has anon FTP. And I\\nstill have root. We\\'ll use that.\\'\\n\\nGandalf jumped in. `Hang on--does it have Crypt?\\'\\n\\n`Argh! Forget to check. I think it must.\\'\\n\\n`Better check it, m8!\\'\\n\\n`Yeah, OK.\\'\\n\\nPhoenix felt exasperated, rushing around trying to find sites that\\nworked. He logged out of Altos and coursed his way back into the NASA\\nmachine. The admin was still logged on, but Phoenix was running out of\\ntime. He had to find out if the computer had Crypt on it. It did.\\n\\nPhoenix rushed back to Altos. `Back again. We\\'re in business.\\'\\n\\n`Yes!\\' Electron said, but he quickly jumped in with a word of warning.\\n`Don\\'t say the exact machine at NASA or the account out loud. Whisper\\nit to Gandalf. I think the ops are listening in on my connection.\\'\\n\\n`Well,\\' Phoenix typed slowly, `there\\'s only one problem. The admin is\\nlogged on.\\'\\n\\n`Arghhh!\\' Electron shouted.\\n\\n`Just do it,\\' Pad said. `No time to worry.\\'\\n\\nPhoenix whispered the Internet IP address of the NASA machine to\\nGandalf.\\n\\n`OK, m8, I\\'ll anon FTP it to NASA. I\\'ll come back here and tell you\\nthe new filename. Then you go in and decrypt it and uncompress the\\nfile. W8 for me here.\\'\\n\\nTen minutes later, Gandalf returned. `Mission accomplished. The file\\nis there!\\'\\n\\n`Now, go go Pheeny!\\' Electron said.\\n\\n`Gand, whisper the filename to me,\\' Phoenix said.\\n\\n`The file\\'s called \"d\" and it\\'s in the pub directory,\\' Gandalf\\nwhispered.\\n\\n`OK, folks. Here we go!\\' Phoenix said as he logged off.\\n\\nPhoenix dashed to the NASA computer, logged in and looked for the file\\nnamed `d\\'. He couldn\\'t find it. He couldn\\'t even find the pub\\ndirectory. He began hunting around the rest of the file system. Where\\nwas the damn thing?\\n\\nUh oh. Phoenix noticed the system administrator, Sharon Beskenis, was\\nstill logged in. She was connected from Phoebe, another NASA machine.\\nThere was only one other user besides himself logged into the CSAB\\nmachine, someone called Carrie. As if that wasn\\'t bad enough, Phoenix\\nrealised his username stood out a like a sore thumb. If the admin\\nlooked at who was on-line she would see herself, Carrie and a user\\ncalled `friend\\', an account he had created for himself. How many\\nlegitimate accounts on NASA computers had that name?\\n\\nWorse, Phoenix noticed that he had forgotten to cover his login trail.\\n`Friend\\' was telnetting into the NASA computer from the University of\\nTexas. No, no, he thought, that would definitely have to go. He\\ndisconnected from NASA, bounced back to the university and then logged\\nin to NASA again. Good grief. Now the damn NASA machine showed two\\npeople logged in as `friend\\'. The computer hadn\\'t properly killed his\\nprevious login. Stress.\\n\\nPhoenix tried frantically to clear out his first login by killing its\\nprocess number. The NASA computer responded that there was no such\\nprocess number. Increasingly nervous, Phoenix figured he must have\\ntyped in the wrong number. Unhinged, he grabbed one of the other\\nprocess numbers and killed that.\\n\\nChrist! That was the admin\\'s process number. Phoenix had just\\ndisconnected Sharon from her own machine. Things were not going well.\\n\\nNow he was under serious pressure. He didn\\'t dare logout, because\\nSharon would no doubt find his `friend\\' account, kill it and close up\\nthe security hole he had originally used to get in. Even if she didn\\'t\\nfind Deszip on her own machine, he might not be able to get back in\\nagain to retrieve it.\\n\\nAfter another frenzied minute hunting around the machine, Phoenix\\nfinally unearthed Gandalf\\'s copy of Deszip. Now, the moment of truth.\\n\\nHe tried the passphrase. It worked! All he had to do\\nwas uncompress Deszip and get it out of there. He typed, `uncompress\\ndeszip.tar.z\\', but he didn\\'t like how the NASA computer answered his\\ncommand:\\n\\ncorrupt input\\n\\nSomething was wrong, terribly wrong. The file appeared to be partially\\ndestroyed. It was too painful a possibility to contemplate. Even if\\nonly a small part of the main Deszip program had been damaged, none of\\nit would be useable.\\n\\nRubbing sweat from his palms, Phoenix hoped that maybe the file had\\njust been damaged as he attempted to uncompress it. He had kept the\\noriginal, so he went back to that and tried decrypting and\\nuncompressing it again. The NASA computer gave him the same ugly\\nresponse. Urgently, he tried yet again, but this time attempted to\\nuncompress the file in a different way. Same problem.\\n\\nPhoenix was at his wits\\' end. This was too much. The most he could\\nhope was that the file had somehow become corrupted in the transfer\\nfrom Gandalf\\'s JANET machine. He logged out of NASA and returned to\\nAltos. The other three were waiting impatiently for him.\\n\\nElectron, still logged in as the mystery Guest, leaped in. `Did it\\nwork?\\'\\n\\n`No. Decrypted OK, but the file was corrupted when I tried to\\ndecompress it.\\'\\n\\n`Arghhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!\\' Gandalf exclaimed.\\n\\n`f**kf**kf**k,\\' Electron wrote. `Doomed to fail.\\'\\n\\n`Sigh Sigh Sigh,\\' Pad typed.\\n\\nGandalf and Electron quizzed Phoenix in detail about each command he\\nhad used, but in the end there seemed only one hope. Move a copy of\\nthe decryption program to the JANET computer in the UK and try\\ndecrypting and uncompressing Deszip there.\\n\\nPhoenix gave Gandalf a copy of Crypt and the British hacker went to\\nwork on the JANET computer. A little later he rendezvoused on Altos\\nagain.\\n\\nPhoenix was beside himself by this stage. `Gand! Work???\\'\\n\\n`Well, I decrypted it using the program you gave me ...\\'\\n\\n`And And And???\\' Electron was practically jumping out of his seat at\\nhis computer.\\n\\n`Tried to uncompress it. It was taking a LONG time. Kept\\ngoing--expanded to 8 megabytes.\\'\\n\\n`Oh NO. Bad Bad Bad,\\' Phoenix moaned. `Should only be 3 meg. If it\\'s\\nmaking a million files, it\\'s f**ked.\\'\\n\\n`Christ,\\' Pad typed. `Too painful.\\'\\n\\n`I got the makefile--licensing agreement text etc., but the Deszip\\nprogram itself was corrupted,\\' Gandalf concluded.\\n\\n`I don\\'t understand what is wrong with it. <Sob>\\' Phoenix wrote.\\n\\n`AgonyAgonyAgony,\\' Electron groaned. `It\\'ll never never never work.\\'\\n\\n`Can we get a copy anywhere else?\\' Gandalf asked.\\n\\n`That FTP bug has been fixed at Purdue,\\' Pad answered. `Can\\'t use that\\nto get in again.\\'\\n\\nDisappointment permeated the atmosphere on Altos.\\n\\nThere were, of course, other possible repositories for Deszip. Phoenix\\nand Electron had already penetrated a computer at Lawrence Livermore\\nNational Labs in California. They had procured root on the gamm5\\nmachine and planned to use it as a launchpad for penetrating security\\nexpert Russell Brand\\'s computer at LLNL, called Wuthel. They were sure\\nBrand had Deszip on his computer.\\n\\nIt would require a good deal of effort, and possibly another\\nroller-coaster ride of desire, expectation and possible\\ndisappointment. For now, the four hackers resolved to sign off,\\nlicking their wounds at their defeat in the quest for Deszip.\\n\\n`Well, I\\'m off. See you l8r,\\' Pad said.\\n\\n`Yeah, me too,\\' Electron added.\\n\\n`Yeah, OK. L8r, m8s!\\' Gandalf said.\\n\\nThen, just for fun, he added in typical Gandalf style, `See you in\\njail!\\'\\n\\n            ',\n",
       " ' 6 -- Page 1 The New York Times.\\n\\n\\nRead about it; Just another incredible scene; There\\'s no doubt about it.\\n\\n-- from `Read About It\\', 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.\\n\\nPad had an important warning for the Australian hackers: the computer\\nsecurity community was closing in on them. It was the end of February\\n1990, not long after Phoenix and Electron had captured Zardoz and just\\nmissed out on Deszip. Pad didn\\'t scream or shout the warning, that\\nwasn\\'t his style. But Electron took in the import of the warning loud\\nand clear.\\n\\n`Feen, they know you did over Spaf\\'s machine,\\' Pad told Phoenix. `They\\nknow it\\'s been you in other systems also. They\\'ve got your handle.\\'\\n\\nEugene Spafford was the kind of computer security expert who loses a\\nlot of face when a hacker gets into his machine, and a wounded bull is\\na dangerous enemy.\\n\\nThe security people had been able to connect and link up a series of\\nbreak-ins with the hacker who called himself Phoenix because his style\\nwas so distinctive. For example, whenever he was creating a root\\nshell--root access--for himself, he would always save it in the same\\nfilename and in the same location on the\\ncomputer. In some instances, he even created accounts called `Phoenix\\'\\nfor himself. It was this consistency of style which had made things so\\nmuch easier for admins to trace his movements.\\n\\nIn his typical understated fashion, Pad suggested a change of style.\\nAnd maybe, he added, it wasn\\'t such a bad idea for the Australians to\\ntone down their activities a bit. The undercurrent of the message was\\nserious.\\n\\n`They said that some security people had contacted Australian law\\nenforcement, who were supposed to be \"dealing with it\",\\' Pad said.\\n\\n`Do they know my real name?\\' Phoenix asked, worried. Electron was also\\nwatching this conversation with some concern.\\n\\n`Don\\'t know. Got it from Shatter. He\\'s not always reliable,\\nbut ...\\'\\n\\nPad was trying to soften the news by playing down Shatter\\'s importance\\nas a source. He didn\\'t trust his fellow British hacker but Shatter had\\nsome good, if mysterious, connections. An enigmatic figure who seemed\\nto keep one foot in the computer underworld and the other in the\\nupright computer security industry, Shatter leaked information to Pad\\nand Gandalf, and occasionally to the Australians.\\n\\nWhile the two British hackers sometimes discounted Shatter\\'s advice,\\nthey also took the time to talk to him. Once, Electron had intercepted\\nemail showing Pengo had turned to Shatter for advice about his\\nsituation after the raid in Germany. With some spare time prior to his\\ntrial, Pengo asked Shatter whether it was safe to travel to the US on\\na summer holiday in 1989. Shatter asked for Pengo\\'s birthdate and\\nother details. Then he returned with an unequivocal answer: Under no\\ncircumstances was Pengo to travel to the US.\\n\\nSubsequently, it was reported that officials in the US Justice\\nDepartment had been examining ways to secretly coax Pengo onto\\nAmerican soil, where they could seize him. They would then force him\\nto face trial in their own courts.\\n\\nHad Shatter known this? Or had he just told Pengo not to go to the US\\nbecause it was good commonsense? No-one was quite sure, but people\\ntook note of what Shatter told them.\\n\\n`Shatter definitely got the info right about Spaf\\'s machine. 100%\\nright,\\' Pad continued. `He knew exactly how you hacked it. I couldn\\'t\\nbelieve it. Be careful if you\\'re still hacking m8, especially on the\\nInet.\\' The `Inet\\' was shorthand for the Internet.\\n\\nThe Altos hackers went quiet.\\n\\n`It\\'s not just you,\\' Pad tried to reassure the Australians. `Two\\nsecurity people from the US are coming to the UK to try and find out\\nsomething about someone named Gandalf. Oh, and Gand\\'s mate, who might\\nbe called Patrick.\\'\\n\\nPad had indeed based his handle on the name Patrick, or Paddy, but\\nthat wasn\\'t his real name. No intelligent hacker would use his real\\nname for his handle. Paddy was the name of one of his favourite\\nuniversity lecturers, an Irishman who laughed a good deal. Like Par\\'s\\nname, Pad\\'s handle had coincidentally echoed a second meaning when the\\nBritish hacker moved into exploring X.25 networks. An X.25 PAD is a\\npacket assembler disassembler, the interface between the X.25 network\\nand a modem or terminal server. Similarly, Gandalf, while being first\\nand foremost the wizard from The Lord of The Rings, also happened to\\nbe a terminal server brand name.\\n\\nDespite the gravity of the news that the security community was\\nclosing the net around them, none of the hackers lost their wicked\\nsense of humour.\\n\\n`You know,\\' Pad went on, `Spaf was out of the country when his machine\\ngot hacked.\\'\\n\\n`Was he? Where?\\' asked Gandalf, who had just joined the conversation.\\n\\n`In Europe.\\'\\n\\nElectron couldn\\'t resist. `Where was Spaf, Gandalf asks as he hears a\\nknock on his door ...\\'\\n\\n`Haha,\\' Gandalf laughed.\\n\\n`<knock> <knock>\\' Electron went on, hamming it up.\\n\\n`Oh! Hello there, Mr Spafford,\\' Gandalf typed, playing along.\\n\\n`Hello, I\\'m Gene and I\\'m mean!\\'\\n\\nAlone in their separate homes on different corners of the globe, the\\nfour hackers chuckled to themselves.\\n\\n`Hello, and is this the man called Patrick?\\' Pad jumped in.\\n\\n`Well, Mr Spafford, it seems you\\'re a right f**king idiot for not\\npatching your FTP!\\' Gandalf proclaimed.\\n\\n`Not to mention the CHFN bug--saved by a Sequent! Or you\\'d be very\\nf**king embarrassed,\\' Phoenix added.\\n\\nPhoenix was laughing too, but he was a little nervous about Pad\\'s\\nwarning and he turned the conversation back to a serious note.\\n\\n`So, Pad, what else did Shatter tell you?\\' Phoenix asked\\nanxiously.\\n\\n`Not much. Except that some of the security investigations might be\\npartly because of UCB.\\'\\n\\nUCB was the University of California at Berkeley. Phoenix had been\\nvisiting machines at both Berkeley and LLNL so much recently that the\\nadmins seemed to have not only noticed him, but they had pinpointed\\nhis handle. One day he had telnetted into dewey.soe.berkeley.edu--the\\nDewey machine as it was known--and had been startled to find the\\nfollowing message of the day staring him in the face:\\n\\nPhoenix,\\n\\nGet out of Dewey NOW!\\n\\nAlso, do not use any of the `soe\\' machines.\\n\\nThank you,\\n\\nDaniel Berger\\n\\nPhoenix did a double take when he saw this public warning. Having been\\nin and out of the system so many times, he just zoomed past the words\\non the login screen. Then, in a delayed reaction, he realised the\\nlogin message was addressed to him.\\n\\nIgnoring the warning, he proceeded to get root on the Berkeley machine\\nand look through Berger\\'s files. Then he sat back, thinking about the\\nbest way to deal with the problem. Finally, he decided to send the\\nadmin a note saying he was leaving the system for good.\\n\\nWithin days, Phoenix was back in the Dewey machine, weaving in and out\\nof it as if nothing had happened. After all, he had broken into the\\nsystem, and managed to get root through his own wit. He had earned the\\nright to be in the computer. He might send the admin a note to put him\\nat ease, but Phoenix wasn\\'t going to give up accessing Berkeley\\'s\\ncomputers just because it upset Daniel Berger.\\n\\n`See,\\' Pad continued, `I think the UCB people kept stuff on their\\nsystems that wasn\\'t supposed to be there. Secret things.\\'\\n\\nClassified military material wasn\\'t supposed to be stored\\non non-classified network computers. However, Pad guessed that\\nsometimes researchers broke rules and took short cuts because they\\nwere busy thinking about their research and not the security\\nimplications.\\n\\n`Some of the stuff might have been illegal,\\' Pad told his captive\\naudience. `And then they find out some of you guys have been in there\\n...\\'\\n\\n`s**t,\\' Phoenix said.\\n\\n`So, well, if it APPEARED like someone was inside trying to get at\\nthose secrets ...\\' Pad paused. `Then you can guess what happened. It\\nseems they really want to get whoever was inside their machines.\\'\\n\\nThere was momentary silence while the other hackers digested all that\\nPad had told them. As a personality on Altos, Pad remained ever so\\nslightly withdrawn from the other hackers, even the Australians whom\\nhe considered mates. This reserved quality gave his warning a certain\\nsobriety, which seeped into the very fabric of Altos that day.\\n\\nEventually, Electron responded to Pad\\'s warning by typing a comment\\ndirected at Phoenix: `I told you talking to security guys is nothing\\nbut trouble.\\'\\n\\nIt irritated Electron more and more that Phoenix felt compelled to\\ntalk to white hats in the security industry. In Electron\\'s view,\\ndrawing attention to yourself was just a bad idea all around and he\\nwas increasingly annoyed at watching Phoenix feed his ego. He had made\\nveiled references to Phoenix\\'s bragging on Altos many times, saying\\nthings like `I wish people wouldn\\'t talk to security guys\\'.\\n\\nPhoenix responded to Electron on-line somewhat piously. `Well, I will\\nnever talk to security guys seriously again.\\'\\n\\nElectron had heard it all before. It was like listening to an\\nalcoholic swear he would never touch another drink. Bidding the others\\ngoodbye, Electron logged off. He didn\\'t care to listen to Phoenix any\\nmore.\\n\\nOthers did, however. Hundreds of kilometres away, in a special room\\nsecreted away inside a bland building in Canberra, Sergeant Michael\\nCostello and Constable William Apro had been methodically capturing\\neach and every electronic boast as it poured from Phoenix\\'s phone. The\\ntwo officers recorded the data transmissions passing in and out of his\\ncomputer. They then played this recording into their own modem and\\ncomputer and created a text file they could save and use as evidence\\nin court.\\n\\nBoth police officers had travelled north from Melbourne, where they\\nworked with the AFP\\'s Computer Crime Unit. Settling into their\\ntemporary desks with their PC and laptop, the officers began their\\nsecret eavesdropping work on 1 February 1990.\\n\\nIt was the first time the AFP had done a datatap. They were happy to\\nbide their time, to methodically record Phoenix hacking into Berkeley,\\ninto Texas, into NASA, into a dozen computers around the world. The\\nphone tap warrant was good for 60 days, which was more than enough\\ntime to secrete away a mountain of damning evidence against the\\negotistical Realm hacker. Time was on their side.\\n\\nThe officers worked the Operation Dabble job in shifts. Constable Apro\\narrived at the Telecommunications Intelligence Branch of the AFP at 8\\np.m. Precisely ten hours later, at 6 the next morning, Sergeant\\nCostello relieved Apro, who knocked off for a good sleep. Apro\\nreturned again at 8 p.m. to begin the night shift.\\n\\nThey were there all the time. Twenty-four hours a day. Seven days a\\nweek. Waiting and listening.\\n\\nIt was too funny. Erik Bloodaxe in Austin, Texas, couldn\\'t stop\\nlaughing. In Melbourne, Phoenix\\'s side hurt from laughing so much.\\n\\nPhoenix loved to talk on the phone. He often called Erik, sometimes\\nevery day, and they spoke for ages. Phoenix didn\\'t worry about cost;\\nhe wasn\\'t paying for it. The call would appear on some poor sod\\'s bill\\nand he could sort it out with the phone company.\\n\\nSometimes Erik worried a little about whether Phoenix wasn\\'t going to\\nget himself in a jam making all these international calls. Not that he\\ndidn\\'t like talking to the Australian; it was a hoot. Still, the\\nconcern sat there, unsettled, in the back of his mind. A few times he\\nasked Phoenix about it.\\n\\n`No prob. Hey, AT&T isn\\'t an Australian company,\\' Phoenix would say.\\n`They can\\'t do anything to me.\\' And Erik had let it rest at that.\\n\\nFor his part, Erik didn\\'t dare call Phoenix, especially not since his\\nlittle visit from the US Secret Service. On 1 March 1990, they burst\\ninto his home, with guns drawn, in a dawn raid. The agents searched\\neverywhere, tearing the student house apart, but they didn\\'t find\\nanything incriminating. They did take Erik\\'s $59 keyboard terminal\\nwith its chintzy little 300 baud modem, but they didn\\'t get his main\\ncomputer, because Erik knew they were coming.\\n\\nThe Secret Service had subpoenaed his academic records, and Erik had\\nheard about it before the raid. So when the Secret Service arrived,\\nErik\\'s stuff just wasn\\'t there. It hadn\\'t been there for a few weeks,\\nbut for Erik, they had been hard weeks. The hacker found himself\\nsuffering withdrawal symptoms, so he bought the cheapest home computer\\nand modem he could find to tide him over.\\n\\nThat equipment was the only computer gear the Secret Service\\ndiscovered, and they were not happy special agents. But without\\nevidence, their hands were tied. No charges were laid.\\n\\nStill, Erik thought he was probably being watched. The last thing he\\nwanted was for Phoenix\\'s number to appear on his home phone bill. So\\nhe let Phoenix call him, which the Australian did all the time. They\\noften talked for hours when Erik was working nights. It was a slack\\njob, just changing the back-up tapes on various computers and making\\nsure they didn\\'t jam. Perfect for a student. It left Erik hours of\\nfree time.\\n\\nErik frequently reminded Phoenix that his phone was probably tapped,\\nbut Phoenix just laughed. `Yeah, well don\\'t worry about it, mate. What\\nare they going to do? Come and get me?\\'\\n\\nAfter Erik put a hold on his own hacking activities, he lived\\nvicariously, listening to Phoenix\\'s exploits. The Australian called\\nhim with a technical problem or an interesting system, and then they\\ndiscussed various strategies for getting into the machine. However,\\nunlike Electron\\'s talks with Phoenix, conversations with Erik weren\\'t\\nonly about hacking. They chatted about life, about what Australia was\\nlike, about girls, about what was in the newspaper that day. It was\\neasy to talk to Erik. He had a big ego, like most hackers, but it was\\ninoffensive, largely couched in his self-effacing humour.\\n\\nPhoenix often made Erik laugh. Like the time he got Clifford Stoll, an\\nastronomer, who wrote The Cuckoo\\'s Egg. The book described his pursuit\\nof a German hacker who had broken into the computer system Stoll\\nmanaged at Lawrence Berkeley Labs near San Francisco. The hacker had\\nbeen part of the same hacking ring as Pengo. Stoll took a hard line on\\nhacking, a position which did not win him popularity in the\\nunderground. Both Phoenix and Erik had read Stoll\\'s book, and one day\\nthey were sitting around chatting about it.\\n\\n`You know, it\\'s really stupid that Cliffy put his email address in his\\nbook,\\' Phoenix said. `Hmm, why don\\'t I go check?\\'\\n\\nSure enough, Phoenix called Erik back about a day later. `Well, I got\\nroot on Cliffy\\'s machine,\\' he began slowly, then he burst out\\nlaughing. `And I changed the message of the day. Now it reads, \"It\\nlooks like the Cuckoo\\'s got egg on his face\"!\\'\\n\\nIt was uproariously funny. Stoll, the most famous hacker-catcher in\\nthe world, had been japed! It was the funniest thing Erik had heard in\\nweeks.\\n\\nBut it was not nearly so amusing as what Erik told Phoenix later about\\nthe New York Times. The paper had published an article on 19 March\\nsuggesting a hacker had written some sort of virus or worm which was\\nbreaking into dozens of computers.\\n\\n`Listen to this,\\' Erik had said, reading Phoenix the lead paragraph,\\n`\"A computer intruder has written a program that has entered dozens of\\ncomputers in a nationwide network in recent weeks, automatically\\nstealing electronic documents containing users\\' passwords and erasing\\nfiles to help conceal itself.\"\\'\\n\\nPhoenix was falling off his chair he was laughing so hard. A program?\\nWhich was automatically doing this? No. It wasn\\'t an automated\\nprogram, it was the Australians! It was the Realm hackers! God, this\\nwas funny.\\n\\n`Wait--there\\'s more! It says, \"Another rogue program shows a\\nwidespread vulnerability\". I laughed my ass off,\\' Erik said,\\nstruggling to get the words out.\\n\\n`A rogue program! Who wrote the article?\\'\\n\\n`A John Markoff,\\' Erik answered, wiping his eyes. `I called him up.\\'\\n\\n`You did? What did you say?\\' Phoenix tried to gather himself together.\\n\\n`\"John,\" I said, \"You know that article you wrote on page 12 of the\\nTimes? It\\'s wrong! There\\'s no rogue program attacking the Internet.\"\\nHe goes, \"What is it then?\" \"It\\'s not a virus or a worm,\" I said.\\n\"It\\'s PEOPLE.\"\\'\\n\\nErik started laughing uncontrollably again.\\n\\n`Then Markoff sounds really stunned, and he goes, \"People?\" And I\\nsaid, \"Yeah, people.\" Then he said, \"How do you know?\" And I said,\\n\"Because, John, I KNOW.\"\\'\\n\\nPhoenix erupted in laughter again. The Times reporter obviously had\\nworms on his mind, since the author of the famous Internet worm,\\nRobert T. Morris Jr, had just been tried and convicted in the US. He\\nwas due to be sentenced in May.\\n\\nUS investigators had tracked the hacker\\'s connections, looping through\\nsite after site in a burrowing manner which they assumed belonged to a\\nworm. The idea of penetrating so many sites all in such a short time\\nclearly baffled the investigators, who concluded it must be a program\\nrather than human beings launching the attacks.\\n\\n`Yeah,\\' Erik continued, `And then Markoff said, \"Can you get me to\\ntalk to them?\" And I said I\\'d see what I could do.\\'\\n\\n`Yeah,\\' Phoenix said. `Go tell him, yes. Yeah, I gotta talk to this\\nidiot. I\\'ll set him straight.\\'\\n\\nPage one, the New York Times, 21 March 1990: `Caller Says he Broke\\nComputers\\' Barriers to Taunt the Experts\\', by John Markoff.\\n\\nTrue, the article was below the crease--on the bottom half of the\\npage--but at least it was in column 1, the place a reader turns to\\nfirst.\\n\\nPhoenix was chuffed. He\\'d made the front page of the New York Times.\\n\\n`The man identified himself only as an Australian named Dave,\\' the\\narticle said. Phoenix chuckled softly. Dave Lissek was the pseudonym\\nhe\\'d used. Of course, he wasn\\'t the only one using the name Dave. When\\nErik first met the Australians on Altos, he marvelled at how they all\\ncalled themselves Dave. I\\'m Dave, he\\'s Dave, we\\'re all Dave, they told\\nhim. It was just easier that way, they said.\\n\\nThe article revealed that `Dave\\' had attacked Spaf\\'s and Stoll\\'s\\nmachines, and that the Smithsonian Astronomical Observatory at Harvard\\nUniversity--where Stoll now worked--had pulled its computers off the\\nInternet as a result of the break in. Markoff had even included the\\n`egg on his face\\' story Phoenix had described to him.\\n\\nPhoenix laughed at how well he had thumbed his nose at Cliffy Stoll.\\nThis article would show him up all right. It felt so good, seeing\\nhimself in print that way. He did that. That was him there in black in\\nwhite, for all the world to see. He had outsmarted the world\\'s best\\nknown hacker-catcher, and he had smeared the insult across the front\\npage of the most prestigious newspaper in America.\\n\\nAnd Markoff reported that he had been in Spaf\\'s system too! Phoenix\\nglowed happily. Better still, Markoff had quoted `Dave\\' on the\\nsubject: `The caller said ... \"It used to be the security guys chasing\\nthe hackers. Now it\\'s the hackers chasing the security people.\"\\'\\n\\nThe article went on: `Among the institutions believed to have been\\npenetrated by the intruder are the Los Alamos National Laboratories,\\nHarvard, Digital Equipment Corporation, Boston University and the\\nUniversity of Texas.\\' Yes, that list sounded about right. Well, for\\nthe Australians as a group anyway. Even if Phoenix hadn\\'t masterminded\\nor even penetrated some of those himself, he was happy to take the\\ncredit in the Times.\\n\\nThis was a red-letter day for Phoenix.\\n\\nElectron, however, was furious. How could Phoenix be so stupid? He\\nknew that Phoenix had an ego, that he talked too much, and that his\\ntendency to brag had grown worse over time, fed by the skyrocketing\\nsuccess of the Australian hackers. Electron knew all of that, but he\\nstill couldn\\'t quite believe that Phoenix had gone so far as to strut\\nand preen like a show pony for the New York Times.\\n\\nTo think that he had associated with Phoenix. Electron was disgusted.\\nHe had never trusted Phoenix--a caution now proved wise. But he had\\nspent hours with him on the phone, with most of the information\\nflowing in one direction. But not only did Phoenix show no discretion\\nat all in dealing with the paper, he bragged about doing things that\\nElectron had done! If Phoenix had to talk--and clearly he should have\\nkept his mouth shut--he should have at least been honest about the\\nsystems for which he could claim credit.\\n\\nElectron had tried with Phoenix. Electron had suggested that he stop\\ntalking to the security guys. He had continually urged caution and\\ndiscretion. He had even subtly withdrawn each time Phoenix suggested\\none of his hair-brained schemes to show off to a security bigwig.\\nElectron had done this in the hope that Phoenix might get the hint.\\nMaybe, if Phoenix couldn\\'t hear someone shouting advice at him, he\\nmight at least listen to someone whispering it. But no. Phoenix was\\nfar too thick for that.\\n\\nThe Internet--indeed, all hacking--was out of bounds for weeks, if not\\nmonths. There was no chance the Australian authorities would let a\\nfront-page story in the Times go by un-heeded. The Americans would be\\nall over them. In one selfish act of hubris, Phoenix had ruined the\\nparty for everyone else.\\n\\nElectron unplugged his modem and took it to his father. During exams,\\nhe had often asked his father to hide it. He didn\\'t have the\\nself-discipline needed to stay away on his own and there was no other\\nway Electron could keep himself from jacking in--plugging his modem\\ninto the wall. His father had become an expert at hiding the device,\\nbut Electron usually still managed to find it after a few days,\\ntearing the house apart until he emerged, triumphant, with the modem\\nheld high above his head. Even when his father began hiding the modem\\noutside the family home it would only postpone the inevitable.\\n\\nThis time, however, Electron vowed he would stop hacking until the\\nfallout had cleared--he had to. So he handed the modem to his father,\\nwith strict instructions, and then tried to distract himself by\\ncleaning up his hard drive and disks. His hacking files had to go too.\\nSo much damning evidence of his activities. He deleted some files and\\ntook others on disks to store at a friend\\'s house. Deleting files\\ncaused Electron considerable pain, but there was no other way. Phoenix\\nhad backed him into a corner.\\n\\nBrimming with excitement, Phoenix rang Electron on a sunny March\\nafternoon.\\n\\n`Guess what?\\' Phoenix was jumping around like an eager puppy at the\\nother end of the line. `We made the nightly news right across the US!\\'\\n\\n`Uhuh,\\' Electron responded, unimpressed.\\n\\n`This is not a joke!\\' We were on cable news all day too. I called Erik\\nand he told me.\\'\\n\\n`Mmm,\\' Electron said.\\n\\n`You know, we did a lot of things right. Like Harvard. We got into\\nevery system at Harvard. It was a good move. Harvard gave us the fame\\nwe needed.\\'\\n\\nElectron couldn\\'t believe what he was hearing. He didn\\'t need any\\nfame--and he certainly didn\\'t need to be busted. The\\nconversation--like Phoenix himself--was really beginning to annoy him.\\n\\n`Hey, and they know your name,\\' Phoenix said coyly.\\n\\nThat got a reaction. Electron gulped his anger.\\n\\n`Haha! Just joshing!\\' Phoenix practically shouted. `Don\\'t worry! They\\ndidn\\'t really mention anyone\\'s name.\\'\\n\\n`Good,\\' Electron answered curtly. His irritation stewed\\nquietly.\\n\\n`So, do you reckon we\\'ll make the cover of Time or Newsweek?\\'\\n\\nGood grief! Didn\\'t Phoenix ever give up? As if it wasn\\'t enough to\\nappear on the 6 o\\'clock national news in a country crawling with\\nover-zealous law enforcement agencies. Or to make the New York Times.\\nHe had to have the weeklies too.\\n\\nPhoenix was revelling in his own publicity. He felt like he was on top\\nof the world, and he wanted to shout about it. Electron had felt the\\nsame wave of excitement from hacking many high-profile targets and\\nmatching wits with the best, but he was happy to stand on the peak by\\nhimself, or with people like Pad and Gandalf, and enjoy the view\\nquietly. He was happy to know he had been the best on the frontier of\\na computer underground which was fresh, experimental and, most of all,\\ninternational. He didn\\'t need to call up newspaper reporters or gloat\\nabout it in Clifford Stoll\\'s face.\\n\\n`Well, what do you reckon?\\' Phoenix asked impatiently.\\n\\n`No,\\' Electron answered.\\n\\n`No? You don\\'t think we will?\\' Phoenix sounded disappointed.\\n\\n`No.\\'\\n\\n`Well, I\\'ll demand it!\\' Phoenix said laughing, `f**k it, we want the\\ncover of Newsweek, nothing less.\\' Then, more seriously, `I\\'m trying to\\nwork out what really big target would clinch it for us.\\'\\n\\n`Yeah, OK, whatever,\\' Electron replied, distancing himself again.\\n\\nBut Electron was thinking, Phoenix, you are a fool. Didn\\'t he see the\\nwarning signs? Pad\\'s warning, all the busts in the US, reports that\\nthe Americans were hunting down the Brits. As a result of these news\\nreports of which Phoenix was so proud, bosses across the world would\\nbe calling their computer managers into their offices and breathing\\ndown their necks about their own computer security.\\n\\nThe brazen hackers had deeply offended the computer security industry,\\nspurring it into action. In the process, some in the industry had also\\nseen an opportunity to raise its own public profile. The security\\nexperts had talked to the law enforcement agencies, who were now\\nclearly sharing information across national borders and closing in\\nfast. The conspirators in\\nthe global electronic village were at the point of maximum\\noverreach.\\n\\n`We could hack Spaf again,\\' Phoenix volunteered.\\n\\n`The general public couldn\\'t give a f**k about Eugene Spafford,\\'\\nElectron said, trying to dampen Phoenix\\'s bizarre enthusiasm. He was\\nall for thumbing one\\'s nose at authority, but this was not the way to\\ndo it.\\n\\n`It\\'d be so funny in court, though. The lawyer would call Spaf and\\nsay, \"So, Mr Spafford, is it true that you are a world-renowned\\ncomputer security expert?\" When he said, \"Yes\" I\\'d jump up and go, \"I\\nobject, your honour, this guy doesn\\'t know jacks**t, \\'cause I hacked\\nhis machine and it was a breeze!\"\\'\\n\\n`Mmm.\\'\\n\\n`Hey, if we don\\'t get busted in the next two weeks, it will be a\\nmiracle,\\' Phoenix continued happily.\\n\\n`I hope not.\\'\\n\\n`This is a lot of fun!\\' Phoenix shouted sarcastically. `We\\'re gonna\\nget busted! We\\'re gonna get busted!\\'\\n\\nElectron\\'s jaw fell to the ground. Phoenix was mad. Only a lunatic\\nwould behave this way. Mumbling something about how tired he was,\\nElectron said goodbye and hung up.\\n\\nAt 5.50 a.m. on 2 April 1990, Electron dragged himself out of bed and\\nmade his way to the bathroom. Part way through his visit, the light\\nsuddenly went out.\\n\\nHow strange. Electron opened his eyes wide in the early morning\\ndimness. He returned to his bedroom and began putting on some jeans\\nbefore going to investigate the problem.\\n\\nSuddenly, two men in street clothes yanked his window open and jumped\\nthrough into the room shouting, `GET DOWN ON THE FLOOR!\\'\\n\\nWho were these people? Half-naked, Electron stood in the middle of his\\nroom, stunned and immobile. He had suspected the police might pay him\\na visit, but didn\\'t they normally wear uniforms? Didn\\'t they announce\\nthemselves?\\n\\nThe two men grabbed Electron, threw him face down onto the floor and\\npulled his arms behind his back. They jammed handcuffs on his\\nwrists--hard--cutting his skin. Then someone kicked him in the\\nstomach.\\n\\n`Are there any firearms in the house?\\' one of the men asked.\\n\\nElectron couldn\\'t answer because he couldn\\'t breathe. The kick had\\nwinded him. He felt someone pull him up from the floor and prop him in\\na chair. Lights went on everywhere and he could see six or seven\\npeople moving around in the hallway. They must have come into the\\nhouse another way. The ones in the hallway were all wearing bibs with\\nthree large letters emblazoned across the front: AFP.\\n\\nAs Electron slowly gathered his wits, he realised why the cops had\\nasked about firearms. He had once joked to Phoenix on the phone about\\nhow he was practising with his dad\\'s .22 for when the feds came\\naround. Obviously the feds had been tapping his phone.\\n\\nWhile his father talked with one of the officers in the other room and\\nread the warrant, Electron saw the police pack up his computer\\ngear--worth some $3000--and carry it out of the house. The only thing\\nthey didn\\'t discover was the modem. His father had become so expert at\\nhiding it that not even the Australian Federal Police could find it.\\n\\nSeveral other officers began searching Electron\\'s bedroom, which was\\nno small feat, given the state it was in. The floor was covered in a\\nthick layer of junk. Half crumpled music band posters, lots of\\nscribbled notes with passwords and NUAs, pens, T-shirts both clean and\\ndirty, jeans, sneakers, accounting books, cassettes, magazines, the\\noccasional dirty cup. By the time the police had sifted through it all\\nthe room was tidier than when they started.\\n\\nAs they moved into another room at the end of the raid, Electron bent\\ndown to pick up one of his posters which had fallen onto the floor. It\\nwas a Police Drug Identification Chart--a gift from a friend\\'s\\nfather--and there, smack dab in the middle, was a genuine AFP\\nfootprint. Now it was a collector\\'s item. Electron smiled to himself\\nand carefully tucked the poster away.\\n\\nWhen he went out to the living room, he saw a policemen holding a\\ncouple of shovels and he wanted to laugh again. Electron had also once\\ntold Phoenix that all his sensitive hacking disks were buried in the\\nbackyard. Now the police were going to dig it up in search of\\nsomething which had been destroyed a few days before. It was too\\nfunny.\\n\\nThe police found little evidence of Electron\\'s hacking at his house,\\nbut that didn\\'t really matter. They already had almost everything they\\nneeded.\\n\\nLater that morning, the police put the 20-year-old Electron into an\\nunmarked car and drove him to the AFP\\'s imposing-looking headquarters\\nat 383 Latrobe Street for questioning.\\n\\nIn the afternoon, when Electron had a break from the endless\\nquestions, he walked out to the hallway. The boyish-faced Phoenix,\\naged eighteen, and fellow Realm member Nom, 21, were walking with\\npolice at the other end of the hall. They were too far apart to talk,\\nbut Electron smiled. Nom looked worried. Phoenix looked annoyed.\\n\\nElectron was too intimidated to insist on having a lawyer. What was\\nthe point in asking for one anyway? It was clear the police had\\ninformation they could only have obtained from\\ntapping his phone. They also showed him logs taken from Melbourne\\nUniversity, which had been traced back to his phone. Electron figured\\nthe game was up, so he might as well tell them the whole story--or at\\nleast as much of it as he had told Phoenix on the phone.\\n\\nTwo officers conducted the interview. The lead interviewer was\\nDetective Constable Glenn Proebstl, which seemed to be pronounced\\n`probe stool\\'--an unfortunate name, Electron thought. Proebstl was\\naccompanied by Constable Natasha Elliott, who occasionally added a few\\nquestions at the end of various interview topics but otherwise kept to\\nherself. Although he had decided to answer their questions truthfully,\\nElectron thought that neither of them knew much about computers and\\nfound himself struggling to understand what they were trying to ask.\\n\\nElectron had to begin with the basics. He explained what the FINGER\\ncommand was--how you could type `finger\\' followed by a username, and\\nthen the computer would provide basic information about the user\\'s\\nname and other details.\\n\\n`So, what is the methodology behind it ... finger ... then, it\\'s\\nnormally ... what is the normal command after that to try and get the\\npassword out?\\' Constable Elliott finally completed her convoluted\\nattempt at a question.\\n\\nThe only problem was that Electron had no idea what she was talking\\nabout.\\n\\n`Well, um, I mean there is none. I mean you don\\'t use finger like that\\n...\\'\\n\\n`Right. OK,\\' Constable Elliott got down to business. `Well, have you\\never used that system before?\\'\\n\\n`Uhm, which system?\\' Electron had been explaining commands for so long\\nhe had forgotten if they were still talking about how he hacked the\\nLawrence Livermore computer or some other site.\\n\\n`The finger ... The finger system?\\'\\n\\nHuh? Electron wasn\\'t quite sure how to answer that question. There was\\nno such thing. Finger was a command, not a computer.\\n\\n`Uh, yes,\\' he said.\\n\\nThe interview went the same way, jolting awkwardly through computer\\ntechnology which he understood far better than either officer.\\nFinally, at the end of a long day, Detective Constable Proebstl asked\\nElectron:\\n\\n`In your own words, tell me what fascination you find with accessing\\ncomputers overseas?\\'\\n\\n`Well, basically, it\\'s not for any kind of personal gain or anything,\\'\\nElectron said slowly. It was a surprisingly difficult question to\\nanswer. Not because he didn\\'t know the answer, but because it was a\\ndifficult answer to describe to someone who had never hacked a\\ncomputer. `It\\'s just the kick of getting in to a system. I mean, once\\nyou are in, you very often get bored and even though you can still\\naccess the system, you may never call back.\\n\\n`Because once you\\'ve gotten in, it\\'s a challenge over and you don\\'t\\nreally care much about it,\\' Electron continued, struggling. `It\\'s a\\nhot challenge thing, trying to do things that other people are also\\ntrying to do but can\\'t.\\n\\n`So, I mean, I guess it is a sort of ego thing. It\\'s knowing that you\\ncan do stuff that other people cannot, and well, it is the\\nchallenge and the ego boost you get from doing something well ...\\nwhere other people try and fail.\\'\\n\\nA few more questions and the day-long interview finally\\nfinished. The police then took Electron to the Fitzroy police\\nstation. He guessed it was the nearest location with a JP they could\\nfind willing to process a bail application at that hour.\\n\\nIn front of the ugly brick building, Electron noticed a small group of\\npeople gathered on the footpath in the dusky light. As the police car\\npulled up, the group swung into a frenzy of activity, fidgeting in\\nover-the-shoulder briefcases, pulling out notebooks and pens, scooping\\nup big microphones with fuzzy shag covers, turning on TV camera\\nlights.\\n\\nOh NO! Electron wasn\\'t prepared for this at all.\\n\\nFlanked by police, Electron stepped out of the police car and blinked\\nin the glare of photographers\\' camera flashes and TV camera\\nsearchlights. The hacker tried to ignore them, walking as briskly as\\nhis captors would allow. Sound recordists and reporters tagged beside\\nhim, keeping pace, while the TV cameramen and photographers weaved in\\nfront of him. Finally he escaped into the safety of the watchhouse.\\n\\nFirst there was paperwork, followed by the visit to the JP. While\\nshuffling through his papers, the JP gave Electron a big speech about\\nhow defendants often claimed to have been beaten by the police.\\nSitting in the dingy meeting room, Electron felt somewhat confused by\\nthe purpose of this tangential commentary. However, the JP\\'s next\\nquestion cleared things up: `Have you had any problems with your\\ntreatment by the police which you would like to record at this time?\\'\\n\\nElectron thought about the brutal kick he had suffered while lying on\\nhis bedroom floor, then he looked up and found Detective Constable\\nProebstl staring him in the eye. A slight smile passed across the\\ndetective\\'s face.\\n\\n`No,\\' Electron answered.\\n\\nThe JP proceeded to launch into another speech which Electron found\\neven stranger. There was another defendant in the lock-up at the\\nmoment, a dangerous criminal who had a disease the JP knew about, and\\nthe JP could decide to lock Electron up with that criminal instead of\\ngranting him bail.\\n\\nWas this meant to be helpful warning, or just the gratification of\\nsome kind of sadistic tendency? Electron was baffled but he didn\\'t\\nhave to consider the situation for long. The JP granted bail.\\nElectron\\'s father came to the watchhouse, collected his son and signed\\nthe papers for a $1000 surety--to be paid if Electron skipped town.\\nThat night Electron watched as his name appeared on the late night\\nnews.\\n\\nAt home over the next few weeks, Electron struggled to come to terms\\nwith the fact that he would have to give up hacking forever. He still\\nhad his modem, but no computer. Even if he had a machine, he realised\\nit was far too dangerous to even contemplate hacking again.\\n\\nSo he took up drugs instead.\\n\\n\\nElectron\\'s father waited until the very last days of his illness, in\\nMarch 1991, before he went into hospital. He knew that once he went\\nin, he would not be coming out again.\\n\\nThere was so much to do before that trip, so many things to organise.\\nThe house, the life insurance paperwork, the will, the funeral, the\\ninstructions for the family friend who promised to watch over both\\nchildren when he was gone. And, of course, the children themselves.\\n\\nHe looked at his two children and worried. Despite their ages of 21\\nand 19, they were in many ways still very sheltered. He realised that\\nElectron\\'s anti-establishment attitude and his sister\\'s emotional\\nremoteness would remain unresolved difficulties at the time of his\\ndeath. As the cancer progressed, Electron\\'s father tried to tell both\\nchildren how much he cared for them. He might have been somewhat\\nemotionally remote himself in the past, but with so little time left,\\nhe wanted to set the record straight.\\n\\nOn the issue of Electron\\'s problems with the police, however,\\nElectron\\'s father maintained a hands-off approach. Electron had only\\ntalked to his father about his hacking exploits occasionally, usually\\nwhen he had achieved what he considered to be a very noteworthy hack.\\nHis father\\'s view was always the same. Hacking is illegal, he told his\\nson, and the police will probably eventually catch you. Then you will\\nhave to deal with the problem yourself. He didn\\'t lecture his son, or\\nforbid Electron from hacking. On this issue he considered his son old\\nenough to make his own choices and live with the consequences.\\n\\nTrue to his word, Electron\\'s father had shown little sympathy for his\\nson\\'s legal predicament after the police raid. He remained neutral on\\nthe subject, saying only, `I told you something like this would happen\\nand now it is your responsibility\\'.\\n\\nElectron\\'s hacking case progressed slowly over the year, as did his\\nuniversity accounting studies. In March 1991, he faced committal\\nproceedings and had to decide whether to fight his committal.\\n\\nHe faced fifteen charges, most of which were for obtaining\\nunauthorised access to computers in the US and Australia. A few were\\naggravated offences, for obtaining access to data of a commercial\\nnature. On one count each, the DPP (the Office of the Commonwealth\\nDirector of Public Prosecutions) said he altered and erased data.\\nThose two counts were the result of his inserting backdoors for\\nhimself, not because he did damage to any files. The evidence was\\nreasonably strong: telephone intercepts and datataps on Phoenix\\'s\\nphone which showed him talking to Electron about hacking; logs of\\nElectron\\'s own sessions in Melbourne University\\'s systems which were\\ntraced back to his home phone; and Electron\\'s own confession to the\\npolice.\\n\\nThis was the first major computer hacking case in Australia under the\\nnew legislation. It was a test case--the test case for computer\\nhacking in Australia--and the DPP was going in hard. The case had\\ngenerated seventeen volumes of evidence, totalling some 25000 pages,\\nand Crown prosecutor Lisa West planned to call up to twenty expert\\nwitnesses from Australia, Europe and the US.\\n\\nThose witnesses had some tales to tell about the Australian hackers,\\nwho had caused havoc in systems around the world. Phoenix had\\naccidentally deleted a Texas-based company\\'s inventory of assets--the\\nonly copy in existence according to Execucom Systems Corporation. The\\nhackers had also baffled security personnel at the US Naval Research\\nLabs. They had bragged to the New York Times. And they forced NASA to\\ncut off its computer network for 24 hours.\\n\\nAFP Detective Sergeant Ken Day had flown halfway around the world to\\nobtain a witness statement from none other than NASA Langley computer\\nmanager Sharon Beskenis--the admin Phoenix had accidentally kicked off\\nher own system when he was trying to get Deszip. Beskenis had been\\nmore than happy to oblige and on 24 July 1990 she signed a statement\\nin Virginia, witnessed by Day. Her statement said that, as a result of\\nthe hackers\\' intrusion, `the entire NASA computer system was\\ndisconnected from any external communications with the rest of the\\nworld\\' for about 24 hours on 22 February 1990.\\n\\nIn short, Electron thought, there didn\\'t seem to be much chance of\\nwinning at the committal hearing. Nom seemed to feel the same way. He\\nfaced two counts, both `knowingly concerned\\' with Phoenix obtaining\\nunauthorised access. One was for NASA Langley, the other for\\nCSIRO--the Zardoz file. Nom didn\\'t fight his committal either,\\nalthough Legal Aid\\'s refusal\\nto fund a lawyer for the procedure no doubt weighed in his\\ndecision.\\n\\nOn 6 March 1991, Magistrate Robert Langton committed Electron and Nom\\nto stand trial in the Victorian County Court.\\n\\nPhoenix, however, didn\\'t agree with his fellow hackers\\' point of view.\\nWith financial help from his family, he had decided to fight his\\ncommittal. He wasn\\'t going to hand this case to the prosecution on a\\nsilver platter, and they would have to fight him every step of the\\nway, dragging him forward from proceeding to proceeding. His\\nbarrister, Felicity Hampel, argued the court should throw out 47 of\\nthe 48 charges against her client on jurisdictional grounds. All but\\none charge--breaking into the CSIRO machine in order to steal\\nZardoz--related to hacking activities outside Australia. How could an\\nAustralian court claim jurisdiction over a hacked computer in Texas?\\n\\nPrivately, Phoenix worried more about being extradited to the US than\\ndealing with the Australian courts, but publicly he was going into the\\ncommittal with all guns blazing. It was a test case in many ways; not\\nonly the first major hacking case in Australia but also the first time\\na hacker had fought Australian committal proceedings for computer\\ncrimes.\\n\\nThe prosecution agreed to drop one of the 48 counts, noting it was a\\nduplicate charge, but the backdown was a pyrrhic victory for Phoenix.\\nAfter a two-day committal hearing, Magistrate John Wilkinson decided\\nHampel\\'s jurisdictional argument didn\\'t hold water and on 14 August\\n1991 he committed Phoenix to stand trial in the County Court.\\n\\nBy the day of Electron\\'s committal, in March, Electron\\'s father had\\nbegun his final decline. The bowel cancer created a roller-coaster of\\ngood and bad days, but soon there were only bad days, and they were\\ngetting worse. On the last day of March, the doctors told him that it\\nwas finally time to make the trip to hospital. He stubbornly refused\\nto go, fighting their advice, questioning their authority. They\\nquietly urged him again. He protested. Finally, they insisted.\\n\\nElectron and his sister stayed with their father for hours that day,\\nand the following one. Their father had other visitors to keep his\\nspirits up, including his brother who fervently beseeched him to\\naccept Jesus Christ as his personal saviour before he died. That way,\\nhe wouldn\\'t burn in hell. Electron looked at his uncle, disbelieving.\\nHe couldn\\'t believe his father was having to put up with such crap on\\nhis deathbed. Still, Electron chose to be discreet. Apart from an\\noccasional rolling of the eyes, he kept his peace at his father\\'s\\nbedside.\\n\\nPerhaps, however, the fervent words did some good, for as Electron\\'s\\nfather spoke about the funeral arrangements, he made a strange slip of\\nthe tongue. He said `wedding\\' instead of funeral, then paused,\\nrealising his mistake. Glancing slowly down at the intricate braided\\nsilver wedding band still on his finger, he smiled frailly and said,\\n`I suppose, in a way, it will be like a wedding\\'.\\n\\nElectron and his sister went to hospital every day for four days, to\\nsit by their father\\'s bed.\\n\\nAt 6 a.m. on the fifth day, the telephone rang. It was the family\\nfriend their father had asked to watch over them. Their father\\'s life\\nsigns were very, very weak, fluttering on the edge of death.\\n\\nWhen Electron and his sister arrived at the hospital, the nurse\\'s face\\nsaid everything. They were too late. Their father had died ten minutes\\nbefore they arrived. Electron broke down and wept. He hugged his\\nsister, who, for a brief moment, seemed almost reachable. Driving them\\nback to the house, the family friend stopped and bought them an\\nanswering machine.\\n\\n`You\\'ll need this when everyone starts calling in,\\' she told them.\\n`You might not want to talk to anyone for a while.\\'\\n\\nIn the months after his bust in 1990 Electron began smoking marijuana\\nregularly. At first, as with many other university students, it was a\\nsocial thing. Some friends dropped by, they happened to have a few\\njoints, and so everybody went out for a night on the town. When he was\\nin serious hacking mode, he never smoked. A clear head was much too\\nimportant. Besides, the high he got from hacking was a hundred times\\nbetter than anything dope could ever do for him.\\n\\nWhen Phoenix appeared on the front page of the New York Times,\\nElectron gave up hacking. And even if he had been tempted to return to\\nit, he didn\\'t have anything to hack with after the police took his\\nonly computer. Electron found himself casting around for something to\\ndistract him from his father\\'s deteriorating condition and the void\\nleft by giving up hacking. His accounting studies didn\\'t quite fit the\\nbill. They had always seemed empty, but never more so than now.\\n\\nSmoking pot filled the void. So did tripping. Filled it very nicely.\\nBesides, he told himself, it\\'s harder to get caught smoking dope in\\nyour friends\\' houses than hacking in your own. The habit grew\\ngradually. Soon, he was smoking dope at home. New friends began coming\\naround, and they seemed to have drugs with them all the time--not just\\noccasionally, and not just for fun.\\n\\nElectron and his sister had been left the family home and enough money\\nto give them a modest income. Electron began spending this money on\\nhis new-found hobby. A couple of Electron\\'s new friends moved into the\\nhouse for a few months. His sister didn\\'t like them dealing drugs out\\nof the place, but Electron didn\\'t care what was happening around him.\\nHe just sat in his room, listening to his stereo, smoking dope,\\ndropping acid and watching the walls.\\n\\nThe headphones blocked out everyone in the house, and, more\\nimportantly, what was going on inside Electron\\'s own head. Billy\\nBragg. Faith No More. Cosmic Psychos. Celibate Rifles. Jane\\'s\\nAddiction. The Sex Pistols. The Ramones. Music gave Electron a\\npinpoint, a figurative dot of light on his forehead where he could\\nfocus his mind. Blot out the increasingly strange thoughts creeping\\nthrough his consciousness.\\n\\nHis father was alive. He was sure of it. He knew it, like he knew the\\nsun would rise tomorrow. Yet he had seen his father lying, dead, in\\nthe hospital bed. It didn\\'t make sense.\\n\\nSo he took another hit from the bong, floated in slow motion to his\\nbed, lay down, carefully slid the earphones over his head, closed his\\neyes and tried to concentrate on what the Red Hot Chilli Peppers were\\nsaying instead. When that wasn\\'t enough, he ventured down the hallway,\\ndown to his new friends--the friends with the acid tabs. Then, eight\\nmore hours without having to worry about the strange thoughts.\\n\\nSoon people began acting strangely too. They would tell Electron\\nthings, but he had trouble understanding them. Pulling a milk carton\\nfrom the fridge and sniffing it, Electron\\'s sister might say, `Milk\\'s\\ngone off\\'. But Electron wasn\\'t sure what she meant. He would look at\\nher warily. Maybe she was trying to tell him something else, about\\nspiders. Milking spiders for venom.\\n\\nWhen thoughts like these wafted through Electron\\'s mind, they\\ndisturbed him, lingering like a sour smell. So he floated back to the\\nsafety of his room and listened to songs by Henry Rollins.\\n\\nAfter several months in this cloudy state of limbo, Electron awoke one\\nday to find the Crisis Assessment Team--a mobile psychiatric team--in\\nhis bedroom. They asked him questions, then they tried to feed him\\nlittle blue tablets. Electron didn\\'t want to take the tablets. Were\\nlittle blue pills placebos? He was sure they were. Or maybe they were\\nsomething more sinister.\\n\\nFinally, the CAT workers convinced Electron to take the Stelazine\\ntablet. But when they left, terrifying things began to happen.\\nElectron\\'s eyes rolled uncontrollably to the back of his head. His\\nhead twisted to the left. His mouth dropped open, very wide. Try as he\\nmight, he couldn\\'t shut it, any more than he could turn his head\\nstraight. Electron saw himself in the mirror and he panicked. He\\nlooked like a character out of a horror\\npicture.\\n\\nHis new house-mates reacted to this strange new behaviour by trying to\\npsychoanalyse Electron, which was less than helpful. They discussed\\nhim as if he wasn\\'t even present. He felt like a ghost and, agitated\\nand confused, he began telling his friends that he was going to kill\\nhimself. Someone called the CAT team again. This time they refused to\\nleave unless he would guarantee not to attempt suicide.\\n\\nElectron refused. So they had him committed.\\n\\nInside the locked psychiatric ward of Plenty Hospital (now known as\\nNEMPS), Electron believed that, although he had gone crazy, he wasn\\'t\\nreally in a hospital psychiatric ward. The place was just supposed to\\nlook like one. His father had set it\\nall up.\\n\\nElectron refused to believe anything that anyone told him. It was all\\nlies. They said one thing, but always meant another.\\n\\nHe had proof. Electron read a list of patients\\' names on the wall and\\nfound one called Tanas. That name had a special meaning. It was an\\nanagram for the word `Santa\\'. But Santa Claus was a myth, so the name\\nTanas appearing on the hospital list proved to him that he shouldn\\'t\\nlisten to anything anyone told him.\\n\\nElectron ate his meals mostly in silence, trying to ignore the\\nvoluntary and involuntary patients who shared the dining hall. One\\nlunchtime, a stranger sat down at Electron\\'s table and started talking\\nto him. Electron found it excruciatingly painful talking to other\\npeople, and he kept wishing the stranger would go away.\\n\\nThe stranger talked about how good the drugs were in\\nhospital.\\n\\n`Mm,\\' Electron said. `I used to do a lot of drugs.\\'\\n\\n`How much is a lot?\\'\\n\\n`I spent $28000 on dope alone in about four months.\\'\\n\\n`Wow,\\' the stranger said, impressed. `Of course, you don\\'t have to pay\\nfor drugs. You can always get them for free. I do.\\'\\n\\n`You do?\\' Electron asked, somewhat perplexed.\\n\\n`Sure! All the time,\\' the stranger said grandly. `No problem. Just\\nwatch.\\'\\n\\nThe stranger calmly put his fork down on the tray, carefully stood up\\nand then began yelling at the top of his lungs. He waved his arms\\naround frantically and shouted abuse at the other patients.\\n\\nTwo nurses came running from the observation room. One of them tried\\nto calm the stranger down while the other quickly measured out various\\npills and grabbed a cup of water. The stranger swallowed the pills,\\nchased them with a swig of water and sat down quietly. The nurses\\nretreated, glancing back over their shoulders.\\n\\n`See?\\' The stranger said. `Well, I\\'d better be on my way, before the\\npills kick in. See ya.\\'\\n\\nElectron watched, amazed, as the stranger picked up his bag, walked\\nthrough the dining-hall door, and straight out the front door of the\\npsychiatric ward.\\n\\nAfter a month, the psychiatrists reluctantly allowed Electron to leave\\nthe hospital in order to stay with his maternal grandmother in\\nQueensland. He was required to see a psychiatrist regularly. He spent\\nhis first few days in Queensland believing he was Jesus Christ. But he\\ndidn\\'t hold onto that one for long. After two weeks of patiently\\nwaiting and checking for signs of the imminent apocalypse, consistent\\nwith the second coming, he decided he was really the reincarnation of\\nBuddha.\\n\\nIn late February 1992, after three months of psychiatric care up\\nnorth, Electron returned to Melbourne and his university studies, with\\na bag full of medication. Prozac, major tranquillisers, Lithium. The\\ndaily routine went smoothly for a while. Six Prozac--two in the\\nmorning, two at midday and two at night. Another anti-depressant to be\\ntaken at night. Also at night, the anti-side effect tablets to combat\\nthe involuntary eye-rolling, jaw-dropping and neck-twisting associated\\nwith the anti-depressants.\\n\\nAll of it was designed to help him deal with what had by\\nnow become a long list of diagnoses. Cannabis psychosis.\\nSchizophrenia. Manic depression. Unipolar effective disorder.\\nSchizophrenaform. Amphetamine psychosis. Major effective disorder.\\nAtypical psychosis. And his own personal favourite--facticious\\ndisorder, or faking it to get into hospital. But the medication wasn\\'t\\nhelping much. Electron still felt wretched, and returning to a host of\\nproblems in Melbourne made things worse.\\n\\nBecause of his illness, Electron had been largely out of the loop of\\nlegal proceedings. Sunny Queensland provided a welcome escape. Now he\\nwas back in Victoria facing a tedious university course in accounting,\\nan ongoing battle with mental illness, federal charges which could see\\nhim locked up for ten years, and publicity surrounding the first major\\nhacking case in Australia. It was going to be a hard winter.\\n\\nTo make matters worse, Electron\\'s medication interfered with his\\nability to study properly. The anti-side effect pills relaxed the\\nmuscles in his eyes, preventing them from focusing. The writing on the\\nblackboard at the front of the lecture hall was nothing but a hazy\\nblur. Taking notes was also a problem. The medication made his hands\\ntremble, so he couldn\\'t write properly. By the end of a lecture,\\nElectron\\'s notes were as unreadable as the blackboard. Frustrated,\\nElectron stopped taking his medicine, started smoking dope again and\\nsoon felt a little better. When the dope wasn\\'t enough, he turned to\\nmagic mushrooms and hallucinogenic cactus.\\n\\nThe hacking case was dragging on and on. On 6 December 1991, just\\nafter he left psych hospital but before he flew to Queensland, the\\noffice of the DPP had formally filed an indictment containing fifteen\\ncharges against Electron, and three against Nom, in the Victorian\\nCounty Court.\\n\\nElectron didn\\'t talk to Phoenix much any more, but the DPP lawyers\\nhadn\\'t forgotten about him--far from it. They had much bigger plans\\nfor Phoenix, perhaps because he was fighting every step of the way.\\nPhoenix was uncooperative with police in the interview on the day of\\nthe raid, frequently refusing to answer their questions. When they\\nasked to fingerprint him, he refused and argued with them about it.\\nThis behaviour did not endear him to either the police or the DPP.\\n\\nOn 5 May 1992, the DPP filed a final indictment with 40 charges\\nagainst Phoenix in the County Court. The charges, in conjunction with\\nthose against Electron and Nom, formed part of a joint indictment\\ntotalling 58 counts.\\n\\nElectron worried about being sent to prison. Around the world, hackers\\nwere under siege--Par, Pengo, LOD and Erik Bloodaxe, MOD, The Realm\\nhackers, Pad and Gandalf and, most recently, the International\\nSubversives. Somebody seemed to be trying to make a point.\\nFurthermore, Electron\\'s charges had changed considerably--for the\\nworse--from the original ones documented in April 1990.\\n\\nThe DPP\\'s final indictment bore little resemblance to the original\\ncharge sheet handed to the young hacker when he left the police\\nstation the day he was raided. The final indictment read like a\\nveritable Who\\'s Who of prestigious institutions around the world.\\nLawrence Livermore Labs, California. Two different computers at the US\\nNaval Research Laboratories, Washington DC. Rutgers University, New\\nJersey. Tampere University of Technology, Finland. The University of\\nIllinios. Three different computers at the University of Melbourne.\\nHelsinki University of Technology, Finland. The University of New\\nYork. NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia. CSIRO, Carlton,\\nVictoria.\\n\\nThe charges which worried Electron most related to the\\nUS Naval Research Labs, CSIRO, Lawrence Livermore Labs\\nand NASA. The last three weren\\'t full hacking charges. The\\nDPP alleged Electron had been `knowingly concerned\\' with Phoenix\\'s\\naccess of these sites.\\n\\nElectron looked at the thirteen-page joint indictment and didn\\'t know\\nwhether to laugh or cry. He had been a lot more than `knowingly\\nconcerned\\' with accessing those sites. In many cases, he had given\\nPhoenix access to those computers in the first place. But Electron\\ntried to tread quietly, carefully, through most systems, while Phoenix\\nhad noisily stomped around with all the grace of a buffalo--and left\\njust as many footprints. Electron hardly wanted to face full charges\\nfor those or any other sites. He had broken into thousands of sites on\\nthe X.25 network, but he hadn\\'t been charged with any of them. He\\ncouldn\\'t help feeling a little like the gangster Al Capone being done\\nfor tax evasion.\\n\\nThe proceedings were attracting considerable media attention. Electron\\nsuspected the AFP or the DPP were alerting the media to upcoming court\\nappearances, perhaps in part to prove to the Americans that `something\\nwas being done\\'.\\n\\nThis case had American pressure written all over it. Electron\\'s\\nbarrister, Boris Kayser, said he suspected that `the\\nAmericans\\'--American institutions, companies or government\\nagencies--were indirectly funding some of the prosecution\\'s case by\\noffering to pay for US witnesses to attend the trial. The Americans\\nwanted to see the Australian hackers go down, and they were throwing\\nall their best resources at the case to make sure it happened.\\n\\nThere was one other thing--in some ways the most disturbing matter of\\nall. In the course of the legal to-ing and fro-ing, Electron was told\\nthat it was the US Secret Service back in 1988 which had triggered the\\nAFP investigation into The Realm hackers--an investigation which had\\nled to Electron\\'s bust and current legal problems. The Secret Service\\nwas after the hackers who broke into Citibank.\\n\\nAs it happened, Electron had never touched Citibank. Credit cards\\ncouldn\\'t interest him less. He found banks boring and, the way he\\nlooked at it, their computers were full of mundane numbers belonging\\nto the world of accounting. He had already suffered through enough of\\nthose tedious types of numbers in his university course. Unless he\\nwanted to steal from banks--something he would not do--there was no\\npoint in breaking into their computers.\\n\\nBut the US Secret Service was very interested in banks--and in\\nPhoenix. For they didn\\'t just believe that Phoenix had been inside\\nCitibank\\'s computers. They believed he had masterminded the Citibank\\nattack.\\n\\nAnd why did the US Secret Service think that? Because, Electron was\\ntold, Phoenix had gone around bragging about it in the underground. He\\nhadn\\'t just told people he had hacked into Citibank computers, he\\nreportedly boasted that he had stolen some $50000 from the bank.\\n\\nGoing through his legal brief, Electron had discovered something which\\nseemed to confirm what he was being told. The warrant for the\\ntelephone tap on both of Phoenix\\'s home phones mentioned a potential\\n`serious loss to Citibank\\' as a justification for the warrant.\\nStrangely, the typed words had been crossed out in the handwritten\\nscrawl of the judge who approved the warrant. But they were still\\nlegible. No wonder the US Secret Service began chasing the case,\\nElectron thought. Banks get upset when they think people have found a\\nway to rip them off anonymously.\\n\\nElectron knew that Phoenix hadn\\'t stolen any money from Citibank.\\nRather, he had been circulating fantastic stories about himself to\\npuff up his image in the underground, and in the process had managed\\nto get them all busted.\\n\\nIn September 1992, Phoenix rang Electron suggesting they get together\\nto discuss the case. Electron wondered why. Maybe he suspected\\nsomething, sensing that the links binding them were weak, and becoming\\nweaker by the month. That Electron\\'s mental illness had changed his\\nperception of the world. That his increasingly remote attitude to\\nPhoenix suggested an underlying anger about the continual bragging.\\nWhatever the reason, Phoenix\\'s gnawing worry must have been confirmed\\nwhen Electron put off meeting with him.\\n\\nElectron didn\\'t want to meet with Phoenix because he didn\\'t like him,\\nand because he thought Phoenix was largely responsible for getting the\\nAustralian hackers into their current predicament.\\n\\nWith these thoughts fermenting in his mind, Electron listened with\\ninterest a few months later when his solicitor, John McLoughlin,\\nproposed an idea. In legal circles, it was nothing new. But it was new\\nto Electron. He resolved to take up McLoughlin\\'s advice.\\n\\nElectron decided to testify as a Crown witness against Phoenix.\\n\\n\\n                  ',\n",
       " ' 7 -- Judgement Day.\\n\\n\\nYour dream world is just about to end.\\n\\n-- from `Dreamworld\\', Diesel and Dust.\\n\\nIn another corner of the globe, the British hackers Pad and Gandalf\\nlearned with horror that the Australian authorities had busted the\\nthree Realm hackers. Electron had simply disappeared one day. A short\\ntime later, Phoenix was gone too. Then the reports started rolling in\\nfrom newspapers and from other Australian hackers on a German board\\nsimilar to Altos, called Lutzifer.\\n\\nSomething else worried Pad. In one of his hacking forays, he had\\ndiscovered a file, apparently written by Eugene Spafford, which said\\nhe was concerned that some British hackers--read Pad and\\nGandalf--would create a new worm, based on the RTM worm, and release\\nit into the Internet. The unnamed British hackers would then be able\\nto cause maximum havoc on thousands of Internet sites.\\n\\nIt was true that Gandalf and Pad had captured copies of various worm\\nsource codes. They fished around inside SPAN until they surfaced with\\na copy of the Father Christmas worm. And, after finally successfully\\nhacking Russell Brand\\'s machine at LLNL, they deftly lifted a complete\\ncopy of the W**K worm. In Brand\\'s machine, they also found a\\ndescription of how someone had broken into SPAN looking for the W**K\\nworm code, but hadn\\'t found it. `That was me breaking into SPAN to\\nlook around,\\' Gandalf laughed, relaying the tale to Pad.\\n\\nDespite their growing library of worm code, Pad had no intention of\\nwriting any such worm. They simply wanted the code to study what\\npenetration methods the worms had used and perhaps to learn something\\nnew. The British hackers prided themselves on never having done\\nanything destructive to systems they hacked. In places where they knew\\ntheir activities had been discovered--such as at the Universities of\\nBath, Edinburgh, Oxford and Strathclyde--they wrote notes to the\\nadmins signed 8lgm. It wasn\\'t only an ego thing--it was also a way of\\ntelling the admins that they weren\\'t going to do anything nasty to the\\nsystem.\\n\\nAt one university, the admins thought 8lgm was some kind\\nof weird variation on a Belgian word and that the hackers who visited\\ntheir systems night after night were from Belgium. At another uni, the\\nadmins made a different guess at the meaning. In the morning, when\\nthey came into work and saw that the hackers had been playing in their\\nsystem all night, they would sigh to each other, `Our eight little\\ngreen men are at it again\\'.\\n\\nAt the University of Lancaster, the hackers wrote a message to the\\nadmins which said: `Don\\'t do anything naughty. We have a good image\\naround the world, so please don\\'t tarnish it or start making up\\nstories about us messing up systems. Don\\'t hold your breath for us to\\nhack you, but keep us in mind.\\' Wherever they went, their message was\\nthe same.\\n\\nNonetheless Pad visualised a scenario where Spaf whipped up the\\ncomputer security and law enforcement people into a frenzied panic and\\ntried to pin all sorts of things on the British hackers, none of which\\nthey had done. The underground saw Spaf as being rabid in his attack\\non hackers, based largely on his response to the RTM worm. And Gandalf\\nhad hacked Spaf\\'s machine.\\n\\nThe crackdown on the Australians, combined with the discovery of the\\nSpaf file, had a profound effect on Pad. Always cautious anyway, he\\ndecided to give up hacking. It was a difficult decision, and weaning\\nhimself from exploring systems night after night was no easy task.\\nHowever, in the face of what had happened to Electron and Phoenix,\\ncontinuing to hack didn\\'t seem worth the risk.\\n\\nWhen Pad gave up hacking, he bought his own NUI so he could access\\nplaces like Altos legitimately. The NUI was expensive--about\\n[sterling]10 an hour--but he was never on for long. Leisurely chats of\\nthe type he once enjoyed in Altos were out of the question, but at\\nleast he could mail letters to his friends like Theorem and Gandalf.\\nThere would have been easier ways to maintain his friendship with\\nGandalf, who lived in Liverpool, only an hour\\'s drive away. But it\\nwouldn\\'t be the same. Pad and Gandalf had never met, or even talked on\\nthe phone. They talked on-line, and via email. That was the way they\\nrelated.\\n\\nPad also had other reasons for giving up hacking. It was an expensive\\nhabit in Britain because British Telecom time-charged for local phone\\ncalls. In Australia, a hacker could stay on-line for hours, jumping\\nfrom one computer to another through the data network, all for the\\ncost of one local call. Like the Australians, Pad could launch his\\nhacking sessions from a local uni or X.25 dial-up. However, an\\nall-night hacking session based on a single phone call might still\\ncost him [sterling]5 or more in timed-call charges--a considerable\\namount of money for an unemployed young man. As it was, Pad had\\nalready been forced to stop hacking for brief periods when he ran out\\nof his dole money.\\n\\nAlthough Pad didn\\'t think he could be prosecuted for hacking under\\nBritish law in early 1990, he knew that Britain was about to enact its\\nown computer crime legislation--the Computer Misuse Act 1990--in\\nAugust. The 22-year-old hacker decided that it was better to quit\\nwhile he was ahead.\\n\\nAnd he did, for a while at least. Until July 1990, when Gandalf, two\\nyears his junior, tempted him with one final hack before the new Act\\ncame into force. Just one last fling, Gandalf told him. After that\\nlast fling in July, Pad stopped hacking again.\\n\\nThe Computer Misuse Act passed into law in August 1990, following two\\nlaw commission reviews on the subject. The Scottish Law Commission\\nissued a 1987 report proposing to make unauthorised data access\\nillegal, but only if the hacker tried to `secure advantage, or cause\\ndamage to another person\\'--including reckless damage.2 Simple look-see\\nhacking would not be a crime under the report\\'s recommendations.\\nHowever, in 1989 The Law Commission of England and Wales issued its\\nown report proposing that simple unauthorised access should be a crime\\nregardless of intent--a recommendation which was eventually included\\nin the law.\\n\\nLate in 1989, Conservative MP Michael Colvin introduced a private\\nmember\\'s bill into the British parliament. Lending her support to the\\nbill, outspoken hacker-critic Emma Nicholson, another Conservative MP,\\nfired public debate on the subject and ensured the bill passed through\\nparliament successfully.\\n\\nIn November 1990, Pad was talking on-line with Gandalf, and his friend\\nsuggested they have one more hack, just one more, for old time\\'s sake.\\nWell, thought Pad, one more--just a one-off thing--wouldn\\'t hurt.\\n\\nBefore long, Pad was hacking regularly again, and when Gandalf tried\\nto give it up, Pad was there luring him to return to his favourite\\npastime. They were like two boys at school, getting each other into\\ntrouble--the kind of trouble which always comes in pairs. If Pad and\\nGandalf hadn\\'t known each other, they probably would both have walked\\naway from hacking forever in 1990.\\n\\nAs they both got back into the swing of things, they tried to make\\nlight of the risk of getting caught. `Hey, you know,\\' Gandalf joked\\non-line more than once, `the first time we actually meet each other in\\nperson will probably be in a police station.\\'\\n\\nCompletely irreverent and always upbeat, Gandalf proved to be a true\\nfriend. Pad had rarely met such a fellow traveller in the real world,\\nlet alone on-line. What others--particularly some American\\nhackers--viewed as prickliness, Pad saw as the perfect sense of\\nhumour. To Pad, Gandalf was the best m8 a fellow could ever have.\\n\\nDuring the time Pad avoided hacking, Gandalf had befriended another,\\nyounger hacker named Wandii, also from the north of England. Wandii\\nnever played much of a part in the international computer underground,\\nbut he did spend a lot of time hacking European computers. Wandii and\\nPad got along pleasantly but they were never close. They were\\nacquaintances, bound by ties to Gandalf in the underground.\\n\\nBy the middle of June 1991, Pad, Gandalf and Wandii were peaking. At\\nleast one of them--and often more--had already broken into systems\\nbelonging to the European Community in Luxembourg, The Financial Times\\n(owners of the FTSE 100 share index), the British Ministry of Defence,\\nthe Foreign Office, NASA, the investment bank SG Warburg in London,\\nthe American computer database software manufacturer Oracle, and more\\nmachines on the JANET network than they could remember. Pad had also\\npenetrated a classified military network containing a NATO system.\\nThey moved through British Telecom\\'s Packet Switched Stream Network\\n(PSS), which was similar to the Tymnet X.25 network, with absolute\\nease.3\\n\\nGandalf\\'s motto was, `If it moves, hack it\\'.\\n\\n\\nOn 27 June 1991, Pad was sitting in the front room of his parent\\'s\\ncomfortable home in greater Manchester watching the last remnants of\\ndaylight disappear on one of the longest days of the year. He loved\\nsummer, loved waking up to streaks of sunlight sneaking through the\\ncracks in his bedroom curtain. He often thought to himself, it doesn\\'t\\nget much better than this.\\n\\nAround 11 p.m. he flicked on his modem and his Atari 520 ST computer\\nin the front sitting room. There were two Atari computers in the\\nhouse--indicative of his deep enthusiasm for computers since neither\\nhis siblings nor his parents had any interest in programming. Most of\\nthe time, however, Pad left the older Atari alone. His elder brother,\\nan aspiring chemist, used it for writing his PhD thesis.\\n\\nBefore dialling out, Pad checked that no-one was on the house\\'s single\\nphone line. Finding it free, he went to check his email on Lutzifer. A\\nfew minutes after watching his machine connect to the German board, he\\nheard a soft thud, followed by a creaking. Pad stopped typing, looked\\nup from his machine and listened. He wondered if his brother, reading\\nin their bedroom upstairs, or his parents, watching telly in the back\\nlounge room, could hear the creaking.\\n\\nThe sound became more pronounced and Pad swung around and looked\\ntoward the hallway. In a matter of seconds, the front door frame had\\nbeen cracked open, prising the door away from its lock. The wood had\\nbeen torn apart by some sort of car jack, pumped up until the door\\ngave way.\\n\\nSuddenly, a group of men burst through from the front doorstep, dashed\\ndown the long hallway and shot up the carpeted stairs to Pad\\'s\\nbedroom.\\n\\nStill sitting at his computer downstairs, Pad swiftly flicked his\\nmodem, and then his computer, off--instantly killing his connection\\nand everything on his screen. He turned back toward the door leading\\nto the sitting room and strained to hear what was happening upstairs.\\nIf he wasn\\'t so utterly surprised, he would almost have laughed. He\\nrealised that when the police had dashed up to his bedroom, they had\\nbeen chasing every stereotype about hackers they had probably ever\\nread. The boy. In his bedroom. Hunched over his computer. Late at\\nnight.\\n\\nThey did find a young man in the bedroom, with a computer. But it was\\nthe wrong one, and for all intents and purposes the wrong computer. It\\ntook the police almost ten minutes of quizzing Pad\\'s brother to work\\nout their mistake.\\n\\nHearing a commotion, Pad\\'s parents had rushed into the hallway while\\nPad peered from the doorway of the front sitting room. A uniformed\\npolice officer ushered everyone back into the room, and began asking\\nPad questions.\\n\\n`Do you use computers? Do you use the name Pad on computers?\\' they\\nasked.\\n\\nPad concluded the game was up. He answered their questions truthfully.\\nHacking was not such a serious crime after all, he thought. It wasn\\'t\\nas if he had stolen money or anything. This would be a drama, but he\\nwas easy-going. He would roll with the punches, cop a slap on the\\nwrist and soon the whole thing would be over and done with.\\n\\nThe police took Pad to his bedroom and asked him questions as they\\nsearched the room. The bedroom had a comfortably lived-in look, with a\\nfew small piles of clothes in the corner, some shoes scattered across\\nthe floor, the curtains hanging crooked, and a collection of music\\nposters--Jimi Hendrix and The Smiths--taped to the wall.\\n\\nA group of police hovered around his computer. One of them began to\\nsearch through Pad\\'s books on the shelves above the PC, checking each\\none as he pulled it down. A few well-loved Spike Milligan works. Some\\nold chess books from when he was captain of the local chess team.\\nChemistry books, purchased by Pad long before he took any classes in\\nthe subject, just to satisfy his curiosity. Physics books. An\\noceanography textbook. A geology book bought after a visit to a cave\\nexcited his interest in the formation of rocks. Pad\\'s mother, a\\nnursing sister, and his father, an electronics engineer who tested\\ngyros on aircraft, had always encouraged their children\\'s interest in\\nthe sciences.\\n\\nThe policeman returned those books to the shelves, only picking out\\nthe computer books, textbooks from programming and maths classes Pad\\nhad taken at a Manchester university. The officer carefully slid them\\ninside plastic bags to be taken away as\\nevidence.\\n\\nThen the police picked through Pad\\'s music tapes--The Stone Roses,\\nPixies, New Order, The Smiths and lots of indie music from the\\nflourishing Manchester music scene. No evidence of anything but an\\neclectic taste in music there.\\n\\nAnother policeman opened Pad\\'s wardrobe and peered inside. `Anything\\nin here of interest?\\' he asked.\\n\\n`No,\\' Pad answered. `It\\'s all over here.\\' He pointed to the box of\\ncomputer disks.\\n\\nPad didn\\'t think there was much point in the police tearing the place\\nto pieces, when they would ultimately find everything they wanted\\nanyway. Nothing was hidden. Unlike the Australian hackers, Pad hadn\\'t\\nbeen expecting the police at all. Although part of the data on his\\nhard drive was encrypted, there was plenty of incriminating evidence\\nin the un-encrypted files.\\n\\nPad couldn\\'t hear exactly what his parents were talking about with the\\npolice in the other room, but he could tell they were calm. Why\\nshouldn\\'t they be? It wasn\\'t as if their son had done anything\\nterrible. He hadn\\'t beaten someone up in a fist fight at a pub, or\\nrobbed anyone. He hadn\\'t hit someone while drunk driving. No, they\\nthought, he had just been fiddling around with computers. Maybe poking\\naround where he shouldn\\'t have been, but that was hardly a serious\\ncrime. They needn\\'t worry. It wasn\\'t as if he was going to prison or\\nanything. The police would sort it all out. Maybe some sort of\\ncitation, and the matter would be over and done. Pad\\'s mother even\\noffered to make cups of tea for the police.\\n\\nOne of the police struck up a conversation with Pad off to the side as\\nhe paused to drink his tea. He seemed to know that Pad was on the\\ndole, and with a completely straight face, he said, `If you wanted a\\njob, why didn\\'t you just join the police?\\'\\n\\nPad paused for a reality check. Here he was being raided by nearly a\\ndozen law enforcement officers--including representatives from BT and\\nScotland Yard\\'s computer crimes unit--for hacking hundreds of\\ncomputers and this fellow wanted to know why he hadn\\'t just become a\\ncopper?\\n\\nHe tried not to laugh. Even if he hadn\\'t been busted, there is no way\\nhe would ever have contemplated joining the police. Never in a million\\nyears. His family and friends, while showing a pleasant veneer of\\nmiddle-class orderliness, were fundamentally anti-establishment. Many\\nknew that Pad had been hacking, and which sites he had penetrated.\\nTheir attitude was: Hacking Big Brother? Good on you.\\n\\nHis parents were torn, wanting to encourage Pad\\'s interest in\\ncomputers but also worrying their son spent an inordinate amount of\\ntime glued to the screen. Their mixed feelings mirrored Pad\\'s own\\noccasional concern.\\n\\nWhile deep in the throes of endless hacking nights, he would suddenly\\nsit upright and ask himself, What am I doing here, f**king around on a\\ncomputer all day and night? Where is this heading? What about the rest\\nof life? Then he would disentangle himself from hacking for a few days\\nor weeks. He would go down to the university pub to drink with his\\nmostly male group of friends from his course.\\n\\nTall, with short brown hair, a slender physique and a handsomely\\nboyish face, the soft-spoken Pad would have been considered attractive\\nby many intelligent girls. The problem was finding those sort of\\ngirls. He hadn\\'t met many when he was studying at university--there\\nwere few women in his maths and computer classes. So he and his\\nfriends used to head down to the Manchester nightclubs for the social\\nscene and the good music.\\n\\nPad went downstairs with one of the officers and watched as the police\\nunplugged his 1200 baud modem, then tucked it into a plastic bag. He\\nhad bought that modem when he was eighteen. The police unplugged\\ncables, bundled them up and slipped them into labelled plastic bags.\\nThey gathered up his 20 megabyte hard drive and monitor. More plastic\\nbags and labels.\\n\\nOne of the officers called Pad over to the front door. The jack was\\nstill wedged across the mutilated door frame. The police had broken\\ndown the door instead of knocking because they wanted to catch the\\nhacker in the act--on-line. The officer motioned for Pad to follow\\nhim.\\n\\n`Come on,\\' he said, leading the hacker into the night. `We\\'re taking\\nyou to the station.\\'\\n\\nPad spent the night in a cell at the Salford Crescent police\\nstation, alone. No rough crims, and no other hackers either.\\n\\nHe settled into one of the metal cots lined against the perimeter of\\nthe cell, but sleep evaded him. Pad wondered if Gandalf had been\\nraided as well. There was no sign of him, but then again, the police\\nwould hardly be stupid enough to lock up the two hackers together. He\\ntossed and turned, trying to push thoughts from his head.\\n\\nPad had fallen into hacking almost by accident. Compared to others in\\nthe underground, he had taken it up at a late age--around nineteen.\\nAltos had been the catalyst. Visiting BBSes, he read a file describing\\nnot only what Altos was, but how to get there--complete with NUI.\\nUnlike the Australian underground, the embryonic British underground\\nhad no shortage of NUIs. Someone had discovered a stack of BT NUIs and\\nposted them on BBSes across England.\\n\\nPad followed the directions in the BBS file and soon found himself in\\nthe German chat channel. Like Theorem, he marvelled at the brave new\\nlive world of Altos. It was wonderful, a big international party.\\nAfter all, it wasn\\'t every day he got to talk with Australians, Swiss,\\nGermans, Italians and Americans. Before long, he had taken up hacking\\nlike so many other Altos regulars.\\n\\nHacking as a concept had always intrigued him. As a teenager, the film\\nWar Games had dazzled him. The idea that computers could communicate\\nwith each over telephone lines enthralled the sixteen-year-old,\\nfilling his mind with new ideas. Sometime after that he saw a\\ntelevision report on a group of hackers who claimed that they had used\\ntheir skills to move satellites around in space--the same story which\\nhad first caught Electron\\'s imagination.\\n\\nPad had grown up in Greater Manchester. More than a century before,\\nthe region had been a textile boom-town. But the thriving economy did\\nnot translate into great wealth for the masses. In the early 1840s,\\nFriedrich Engels had worked in his father\\'s cotton-milling factory in\\nthe area, and the suffering\\nhe saw in the region influenced his most famous work, The Communist\\nManifesto, published in 1848.\\n\\nManchester wore the personality of a working-class town, a place where\\npeople often disliked the establishment and\\ndistrusted authority figures. The 1970s and 1980s had not been kind to\\nmost of Greater Manchester, with unemployment and urban decay\\ndisfiguring the once-proud textile hub. But this decay only appeared\\nto strengthen an underlying resolve among many from the working\\nclasses to challenge the symbols of power.\\n\\nPad didn\\'t live in a public housing high-rise. He lived in a suburban\\nmiddle-class area, in an old, working-class town removed from the\\ndismal inner-city. But like many people from the north, he disliked\\npretensions. Indeed, he harboured a healthy degree of good-natured\\nscepticism, perhaps stemming from a culture of mates whose favourite\\npastime was pulling each other\\'s leg down at the pub.\\n\\nThis scepticism was in full-gear as he watched the story of how\\nhackers supposedly moved satellites around in space, but somehow the\\nidea slipped through the checkpoints and captured his imagination,\\njust as it had done with Electron. He felt a desire to find out for\\nhimself if it was true and he began pursuing hacking in enthusiastic\\nbursts. At first it was any moderately interesting system. Then he\\nmoved to the big-name systems--computers belonging to large\\ninstitutions. Eventually, working with the Australians, he learned to\\ntarget computer security experts. That was, after all, where the\\ntreasure was stored.\\n\\nIn the morning at the police station, a guard gave Pad something to\\neat which might have passed for food. Then he was escorted into an\\ninterview room with two plain-clothed officers and a BT\\nrepresentative.\\n\\nDid he want a lawyer? No. He had nothing to hide. Besides, the police\\nhad already seized evidence from his house, including unencrypted data\\nlogs of his hacking sessions. How could he argue against that? So he\\nfaced his stern inquisitors and answered their questions willingly.\\n\\nSuddenly things began to take a different turn when they began asking\\nabout the `damage\\' he had done inside the Greater London Polytechnic\\'s\\ncomputers. Damage? What damage? Pad certainly hadn\\'t damaged anything.\\n\\nYes, the police told him. The damage totalling almost a quarter of a\\nmillion pounds.\\n\\nPad gasped in horror. A quarter of a million pounds? He thought back\\nto his many forays into the system. He had been a little mischievous,\\nchanging the welcome message to `Hi\\' and signing it 8lgm. He had made\\na few accounts for himself so he could log in at a later date. That\\nseemed to be nothing special, however, since he and Gandalf had a\\nhabit of making accounts called 8lgm for themselves in JANET systems.\\nHe had also erased logs of his activities to cover his tracks, but\\nagain, this was not unusual, and he had certainly never deleted any\\ncomputer users\\' files. The whole thing had just been a bit of fun, a\\nbit of cat and mouse gaming with the system admins. There was nothing\\nhe could recall which would account for that kind of damage. Surely\\nthey had the wrong hacker?\\n\\nNo, he was the right one all right. Eighty investigators from BT,\\nScotland Yard and other places had been chasing the 8lgm hackers for\\ntwo years. They had phone traces, logs seized from his computer and\\nlogs from the hacked sites. They knew it was him.\\n\\nFor the first time, the true gravity of the situation hit Pad. These\\npeople believed in some way that he had committed serious criminal\\ndamage, that he had even been malicious.\\n\\nAfter about two hours of questioning, they put Pad back in his cell.\\nMore questions tomorrow, they told him.\\n\\nLater that afternoon, an officer came in to tell Pad his mother and\\nfather were outside. He could meet with them in the visiting area.\\nTalking through a glass barrier, Pad tried to reassure his worried\\nparents. After five minutes, an officer told the family the visit was\\nover. Amid hurried goodbyes under the impatient stare of the guard,\\nPad\\'s parents told him they had brought something for him to read in\\nhis cell. It was the oceanography textbook.\\n\\nBack in his cell, he tried to read, but he couldn\\'t concentrate. He\\nkept replaying his visits to the London Polytechnic over and over in\\nhis mind, searching for how he might have inadvertently done\\n[sterling]250000 worth of damage. Pad was a very good hacker; it\\nwasn\\'t as if he was some fourteen-year-old kid barging through systems\\nlike a bull in china shop. He knew how to get in and out of a system\\nwithout hurting it.\\n\\nShortly after 8 p.m., as Pad sat on his cot stewing over the police\\ndamage claims, sombre music seemed to fill his cell. Slowly at first,\\nan almost imperceptible moaning, which subtly transformed into solemn\\nbut recognisable notes. It sounded like Welsh choir music, and it was\\ncoming from above him.\\n\\nPad looked up at the ceiling. The music--all male voices-- stopped\\nabruptly, then started again, repeating the same heavy, laboured\\nnotes. The hacker smiled. The local police choir was practising right\\nabove his cell.\\n\\nAfter another fitful night, Pad faced one more round of interviews.\\nThe police did most of the questioning, but they didn\\'t seem to know\\nmuch about computers--well, not nearly so much as any good hacker on\\nAltos. Whenever either of the police asked a technical question, they\\nlooked over to the BT guy at the other end of the table as if to say,\\n`Does this make any sense?\\' The BT guy would give a slight nod, then\\nthe police looked back at Pad for an answer. Most of the time, he was\\nable to decipher what they thought they were trying to ask, and he\\nanswered accordingly.\\n\\nThen it was back to his cell while they processed his charge sheets.\\nAlone again, Pad wondered once more if they had raided Gandalf. Like\\nan answer from above, Pad heard telephone tones through the walls. The\\npolice seemed to be playing them over and over. That was when he knew\\nthey had Gandalf too.\\n\\nGandalf had rigged up a tone dialler in his computer. It sounded as if\\nthe police were playing with it, trying to figure it out.\\n\\nSo, Pad would finally meet Gandalf in person after two years. What\\nwould he look like? Would they have the same chemistry in person as\\non-line? Pad felt like he knew Gandalf, knew his essence, but meeting\\nin person could be a bit tricky.\\n\\nExplaining that the paperwork, including the charge sheets, had\\nfinally been organised, a police officer unlocked Pad\\'s cell door and\\nled him to a foyer, telling him he would be meeting both Gandalf and\\nWandii. A large collection of police had formed a semi-circle around\\ntwo other young men. In addition to Scotland Yard\\'s Computer Crimes\\nUnit and BT, at least seven other police forces were involved in the\\nthree raids, including those from Greater Manchester, Merseyside and\\nWest Yorkshire. The officers were curious about the hackers.\\n\\nFor most of the two years of their investigation, the police didn\\'t\\neven know the hackers\\' real identities. After such a long, hard chase,\\nthe police had been forced to wait a little longer, since they wanted\\nto nab each hacker while he was on-line. That meant hiding outside\\neach hacker\\'s home until he logged in somewhere. Any system would do\\nand they didn\\'t have to be talking to each other on-line--as long as\\nthe login was illegal. The police had sat patiently, and finally\\nraided the hackers within hours of each other, so they didn\\'t have\\ntime to warn one another.\\n\\nSo, at the end of the long chase and a well-timed operation, the\\npolice wanted to have a look at the hackers up close.\\n\\nAfter the officer walked Pad up to the group, he introduced Gandalf.\\nTall, lean with brown hair and pale skin, he looked a little bit like\\nPad. The two hackers smiled shyly at each other, before one of the\\npolice pointed out Wandii, the seventeen-year-old schoolboy. Pad\\ndidn\\'t get a good look at Wandii, because the police quickly lined the\\nhackers up in a row, with Gandalf in the middle, to explain details to\\nthem. They were being charged under the Computer Misuse Act of 1990.\\nCourt dates would be set and they would be notified.\\n\\nWhen they were finally allowed to leave, Wandii seemed to disappear.\\nPad and Gandalf walked outside, found a couple of benches and lay\\ndown, basking in the sun and chatting while they waited for their\\nrides home.\\n\\nGandalf proved to be as easy to talk to in person as he was on-line.\\nThey exchanged phone numbers and shared notes on the police raids.\\nGandalf had insisted on meeting a lawyer before his interviews, but\\nwhen the lawyer arrived he didn\\'t have the slightest understanding of\\ncomputer crime. He advised Gandalf to tell the police whatever they\\nwanted to know, so the hacker did.\\n\\nThe trial was being held in London. Pad wondered why, if all three\\nhackers were from the north, the case was being tried in the south.\\nAfter all, there was a court in Manchester which was high enough to\\ndeal with their crimes.\\n\\nMaybe it was because Scotland Yard was in London. Maybe they had\\nstarted the paperwork down there. Maybe it was because they were being\\naccused of hacking computers located within the jurisdiction of the\\nCentral Criminal Court--that court being the Old Bailey in London. But\\nPad\\'s cynical side hazarded a different guess--a guess which seemed\\njustified after a few procedural appearances in 1992 before the trial,\\nwhich was set for 1993. For when Pad arrived at the Bow Street\\nMagistrates Court for his committal in April 1992, he saw it packed\\nout with the media, just as he had anticipated.\\n\\nA few hackers also fronted up to fly the flag of the underground. One\\nof them--a stranger--came up to Pad after court, patted him on the\\nback and exclaimed enthusiastically, `Well done, Paddy!\\' Startled, Pad\\njust looked at him and then smiled. He had no idea how to respond to\\nthe stranger.\\n\\nLike the three Australian hackers, Pad, Gandalf and the little-known\\nWandii were serving as the test case for new hacking laws in their\\ncountry. British law enforcement agencies had spent a fortune on the\\ncase--more than [sterling]500000 according to the newspapers--by the\\ntime the 8lgm case went to trial. This was going to be a show case,\\nand the government agencies wanted taxpayers to know they were getting\\ntheir money\\'s worth.\\n\\nThe hackers weren\\'t being charged with breaking into computers. They\\nwere being charged with conspiracy, a more serious offence. While\\nadmitting the threesome did not hack for personal gain, the\\nprosecution alleged the hackers had conspired to break into and modify\\ncomputer systems. It was a strange approach to say the least,\\nconsidering that none of the three hackers had ever met or even talked\\nto the others before they were arrested.\\n\\nIt was not so strange, however, when looking at the potential\\npenalties. If the hackers had been charged with simply breaking into a\\nmachine, without intending any harm, the maximum penalty was six\\nmonths jail and a fine of up to [sterling]5000. However, conspiracy,\\nwhich was covered under a different section of the Act, could bring up\\nto five years in jail and an unlimited amount in fines.\\n\\nThe prosecution was taking a big gamble. It would be harder to prove\\nconspiracy charges, which required demonstration of greater criminal\\nintent than lesser charges. The potential pay-off was of course also\\nmuch greater. If convicted, the defendants in Britain\\'s most important\\nhacking case to date would be going to prison.\\n\\nAs with The Realm case, two hackers--Pad and Gandalf--planned to plead\\nguilty while the third--in this case Wandii--planned to fight the\\ncharges every step of the way. Legal Aid was footing the bill for\\ntheir lawyers, because the hackers were either not working or were\\nworking in such lowly paid, short-term jobs they qualified for free\\nlegal support.\\n\\nWandii\\'s lawyers told the media that this showcase was tantamount to a\\nstate trial. It was the first major hacking case under the new\\nlegislation which didn\\'t involve disgruntled employees. While having\\nno different legal status from a normal trial, the term state trial\\nsuggested a greater degree of official wrath--the kind usually\\nreserved for cases of treason.\\n\\nOn 22 February 1993, within two months of Electron\\'s decision to turn\\nCrown witness against Phoenix and Nom, the three 8lgm hackers stood in\\nthe dock at Southwark Crown Court in South London to enter pleas in\\ntheir own case.\\n\\nIn the dim winter light, Southwark couldn\\'t look less appealing, but\\nthat didn\\'t deter the crowds. The courtroom was going to be packed,\\njust as Bow Street had been. Scotland Yard detectives were turning out\\nin force. The crowd shuffled toward Room 12.\\n\\nThe prosecution told the media they had about 800 computer disks full\\nof evidence and court materials. If all the data had been printed out\\non A4 paper, the stack would tower more than 40 metres in the air,\\nthey said. Considering the massive amount of evidence being heaved,\\nrolled and tugged through the building by teams of legal eagles, the\\nchoice of location--on the fifth floor--proved to be a challenge.\\n\\nStanding in the dock next to Wandii, Pad and Gandalf pleaded guilty to\\ntwo computer conspiracy charges: conspiring to dishonestly obtain\\ntelecommunications services, and conspiring to cause unauthorised\\nmodification to computer material. Pad also pleaded guilty to a third\\ncharge: causing damage to a computer. This last charge related to the\\nalmost a quarter of\\na million pounds worth of `damage\\' to the Central London Polytechnic.\\nUnlike the Australians\\' case, none of the British hackers faced\\ncharges about specific sites such as NASA.\\n\\nPad and Gandalf pleaded guilty because they didn\\'t think they had much\\nchoice. Their lawyers told them that, in light of the evidence,\\ndenying their guilt was simply not a realistic option. Better to throw\\nyourself on the mercy of the court, they advised. As if to underline\\nthe point, Gandalf\\'s lawyer had told him after a meeting at the end of\\n1992, `I\\'d like to wish you a happy Christmas, but I don\\'t think it\\'s\\ngoing to be one\\'.\\n\\nWandii\\'s lawyers disagreed. Standing beside his fellow hackers, Wandii\\npleaded not guilty to three conspiracy charges: plotting to gain\\nunauthorised access to computers, conspiring to make unauthorised\\nmodifications to computer material, and conspiring to obtain\\ntelecommunications services dishonestly. His defence team was going to\\nargue that he was addicted to computer hacking and that, as a result\\nof this addiction, he was not able to form the criminal intent\\nnecessary to be convicted.\\n\\nPad thought Wandii\\'s case was on shaky ground. Addiction didn\\'t seem a\\nplausible defence to him, and he noticed Wandii looked very nervous in\\ncourt just after his plea.\\n\\nPad and Gandalf left London after their court appearance, returning to\\nthe north to prepare for their sentencing hearings, and to watch the\\nprogress of Wandii\\'s case through the eyes of the media.\\n\\nThey weren\\'t disappointed. It was a star-studded show. The media\\nrevved itself up for a feeding frenzy and the prosecution team, headed\\nby James Richardson, knew how to feed the pack. He zeroed in on\\nWandii, telling the court how the schoolboy `was tapping into offices\\nat the EC in Luxembourg and even the experts were worried. He caused\\nhavoc at universities all around the world\\'.4 To do this, Wandii had\\nused a simple BBC Micro computer, a Christmas present costing\\n[sterling]200.\\n\\nThe hacking didn\\'t stop at European Community\\'s computer, Richardson\\ntold the eager crowd of journalists. Wandii had hacked Lloyd\\'s, The\\nFinancial Times and Leeds University. At The Financial Times machine,\\nWandii\\'s adventures had upset the smooth operations of the FTSE 100\\nshare index, known in the City as `footsie\\'. The hacker installed a\\nscanning program in the FT\\'s network, resulting in one outgoing call\\nmade every second. The upshot of Wandii\\'s intrusion: a [sterling]704\\nbill, the deletion of an important file and a management decision to\\nshut down a key system. With the precision of a banker, FT computer\\nboss Tony Johnson told the court that the whole incident had cost his\\norganisation [sterling]24871.\\n\\nBut the FT hack paled next to the prosecution\\'s real trump card: The\\nEuropean Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer in\\nBrussels. They had been left with a [sterling]10000 phone bill as a\\nresult of a scanner Wandii left on its machine,5 the court was told.\\nThe scanner had left a trail of 50000 calls, all documented on a\\n980-page phone bill.\\n\\nThe scanner resulted in the system going down for a day, EORTC\\ninformation systems project manager Vincent Piedboeuf, told the jury.\\nHe went on to explain that the centre needed its system to run 24\\nhours a day, so surgeons could register patients. The centre\\'s\\ndatabase was the focal point for pharmaceutical companies, doctors and\\nresearch centres--all coordinating their efforts in fighting the\\ndisease.\\n\\nFor the media, the case was headline heaven. `Teenage computer hacker\\n\"caused worldwide chaos\"\\' the Daily Telegraph screamed across page\\none. On page three, the Daily Mail jumped in with `Teenage hacker\\n\"caused chaos for kicks\"\\'. Even The Times waded into the fray.\\nSmaller, regional newspapers pulled the story across the countryside\\nto the far reaches of the British Isles. The Herald in Glasgow told\\nits readers `Teenage hacker \"ran up [sterling]10000 telephone bill\"\\'.\\nAcross the Irish Sea, the Irish Times caused a splash with its\\nheadline, `Teenage hacker broke EC computer security\\'.\\n\\nAlso in the first week of the case, The Guardian announced Wandii had\\ntaken down the cancer centre database. By the time The Independent got\\nhold of the story, Wandii hadn\\'t just shut down the database, he had\\nbeen reading the patients\\' most intimate medical details: `Teenager\\n\"hacked into cancer patient files\"\\'. Not to be outdone, on day four of\\nthe trial, the Daily Mail had christened Wandii as a `computer\\ngenius\\'. By day five it labelled him as a `computer invader\\' who `cost\\nFT [sterling]25000\\'.\\n\\nThe list went on. Wandii, the press announced, had hacked the Tokyo\\nZoo and the White House. It was difficult to tell which was the more\\nserious offence.\\n\\nWandii\\'s defence team had a few tricks of its own. Ian MacDonald, QC,\\njunior counsel Alistair Kelman and solicitor Deborah Tripley put\\nLondon University Professor James Griffith-Edwards, an authoritative\\nspokesman on addictive and compulsive behaviours, on the stand as an\\nexpert witness. The chairman of the National Addiction Centre, the\\nprofessor had been part of a team which wrote the World Health\\nOrganisation\\'s definition of addiction. No-one was going to question\\nhis qualifications.\\n\\nThe professor had examined Wandii and he announced his conclusion to\\nthe court: Wandii was obsessed by computers, he was unable to stop\\nusing them, and his infatuation made it impossible for him to choose\\nfreely. `He repeated 12 times in police interviews, \"I\\'m just\\naddicted. I wish I wasn\\'t\",\\' Griffith-Edwards told the court. Wandii\\nwas highly intelligent, but was unable to escape from the urge to beat\\ncomputers\\' security systems at their own game. The hacker was obsessed\\nby the intellectual challenge. `This is the core ... of what attracts\\nthe compulsive gambler,\\' the professor explained to the entranced jury\\nof three women and nine men.\\n\\nBut Wandii, this obsessive, addicted, gifted young man, had never had\\na girlfriend, Griffith-Edwards continued. In fact, he shyly admitted\\nto the professor that he wouldn\\'t even know how to ask a girl out. `He\\n[Wandii] became profoundly embarrassed when asked to talk about his\\nown feelings. He simply couldn\\'t cope when asked what sort of person\\nhe was.\\'6\\n\\nPeople in the jury edged forward in their seats, concentrating\\nintently on the distinguished professor. And why wouldn\\'t they? This\\nwas amazing stuff. This erudite man had delved inside the mind of the\\nyoung man of bizarre contrasts. A man so sophisticated that he could\\npry open computers belonging to some of Britain\\'s and Europe\\'s most\\nprestigious institutions, and yet at the same time so simple that he\\nhad no idea how to ask a girl on a date. A man who was addicted not to\\nbooze, smack or speed, which the average person associates with\\naddiction, but to a computer--a machine most people associated with\\nkids\\' games and word processing programs.\\n\\nThe defence proceeded to present vivid examples of Wandii\\'s addiction.\\nWandii\\'s mother, a single parent and lecturer in English, had terrible\\ntrouble trying to get her son away from his computer and modem. She\\ntried hiding his modem. He found it. She tried again, hiding it at his\\ngrandmother\\'s house. He burgled granny\\'s home and retrieved it. His\\nmother tried to get at his computer. He pushed her out of his attic\\nroom and down the stairs.\\n\\nThen he ran up a [sterling]700 phone bill as a result of his hacking.\\nHis mother switched off the electricity at the mains. Her son\\nreconnected it. She installed a security calling-code on the phone to\\nstop him calling out. He broke it. She worried he wouldn\\'t go out and\\ndo normal teenage things. He continued to stay up all night--and\\nsometimes all day--hacking. She returned from work to find him\\nunconscious--sprawled across the living room floor and looking as\\nthough he was dead. But it wasn\\'t death, only sheer exhaustion. He\\nhacked until he passed out, then he woke up and hacked some more.\\n\\nThe stories of Wandii\\'s self-confessed addiction overwhelmed, appalled\\nand eventually engendered pity in the courtroom audience. The media\\nbegan calling him `the hermit hacker\\'.\\n\\nWandii\\'s defence team couldn\\'t fight the prosecution\\'s\\nevidence head-on, so they took the prosecution\\'s evidence and claimed\\nit as their own. They showed the jury that Wandii hadn\\'t just hacked\\nthe institutions named by the prosecution; he had hacked far, far more\\nthan that. He didn\\'t just hack a lot--he hacked too much. Most of all,\\nWandii\\'s defence team gave the jury a reason to acquit the\\ninnocent-faced young man sitting before them.\\n\\nDuring the trial, the media focused on Wandii, but didn\\'t completely\\nignore the other two hackers. Computer Weekly hunted down where\\nGandalf was working and laid it bare on the front page. A member of\\n`the UK\\'s most notorious hacking gang\\', the journal announced, had\\nbeen working on software which would be used at Barclay\\'s Bank.7 The\\nimplication was clear. Gandalf was a terrible security risk and should\\nnever be allowed to do any work for a financial institution. The\\nreport irked the hackers, but they tried to concentrate on preparing\\nfor their sentencing hearing.\\n\\nFrom the beginning of their case, the hackers had problems obtaining\\ncertain evidence. Pad and Gandalf believed some of the material seized\\nin the police raids would substantially help their case--such as\\nmessages from admins thanking them for pointing out security holes on\\ntheir systems. This material had not been included in the\\nprosecution\\'s brief. When the defendants requested access to it, they\\nwere refused access on the grounds that there was classified data on\\nthe optical disk. They were told to go read the Attorney-General\\'s\\nguidelines on disclosure of information. The evidence of the hackers\\'\\nforays into military and government systems was jumbled in with their\\nintrusions into computers such as benign JANET systems, the defence\\nteam was told. It would take too much time to separate the two.\\n\\nEventually, after some wrangling, Pad and Gandalf were told they could\\ninspect and copy material--provided it was done under the supervision\\nof the police. The hackers travelled to London, to Holborn police\\nstation, to gather supporting evidence for their case. However, it\\nsoon became clear that this time-consuming exercise would be\\nimpossible to manage on an ongoing basis. Finally, the Crown\\nProsecution Service relented, agreeing to release the material on disk\\nto Pad\\'s solicitor, on the proviso that no copies were made, it did\\nnot leave the law office, and it was returned at the end of the trial.\\n\\nAs Wandii\\'s case lurched from revelation to exaggeration, Pad and\\nGandalf busily continued to prepare for their own sentencing hearing.\\nEvery day, Gandalf travelled from Liverpool to Manchester to meet with\\nhis friend. They picked up a handful of newspapers at the local agent,\\nand then headed up to Pad\\'s lawyer\\'s office. After a quick scan for\\narticles covering the hacking case, the two hackers began sifting\\nthrough the reluctantly released prosecution disks. They read through\\nthe material on computer, under the watchful eye of the law office\\'s\\ncashier--the most computer literate person in the firm.\\n\\nAfter fifteen days in the Southwark courtroom listening to fantastic\\nstories from both sides about the boy sitting before them, the jury in\\nWandii\\'s trial retired to consider the evidence. Before they left,\\nJudge Harris gave them a stern warning: the argument that Wandii was\\nobsessed or dependent was not a defence against the charges.\\n\\nIt took the jurors only 90 minutes to reach a decision, and when the\\nverdict was read out the courtroom erupted with a wave of emotion.\\n\\nNot guilty. On all counts.\\n\\nWandii\\'s mother burst into a huge smile and turned to her son, who was\\nalso smiling. And the defence team couldn\\'t be happier. Kelman told\\njournalists, `The jury felt this was a sledge hammer being used to\\ncrack a nut\\'.8\\n\\nThe prosecution was stunned and the law enforcement agents\\nflabbergasted. Detective Sergeant Barry Donovan found the verdict\\nbizarre. No other case in his 21 years in law enforcement had as much\\noverwhelming evidence as this one, yet the jury had let Wandii walk.\\n\\nAnd in a high-pitched frenzy rivalling its earlier hysteria, the\\nBritish media jumped all over the jury\\'s decision. `Hacker who ravaged\\nsystems walks free\\', an indignant Guardian announced. `Computer Genius\\nis cleared of hacking conspiracy\\', said the Evening Standard. `Hacking\\n\"addict\" acquitted\\', sniffed The Times. Overpowering them all was the\\nDaily Telegraph\\'s page one: `Teenage computer addict who hacked White\\nHouse system is cleared\\'.\\n\\nThen came the media king-hit. Someone had leaked another story and it\\nlooked bad. The report, in the Mail on Sunday, said that the three\\nhackers had broken into a Cray computer at the European Centre for\\nMedium Range Weather Forecasting at Bracknell. This computer, likes\\ndozens of others, would normally have been relegated to the long list\\nof unmentioned victims except for one thing. The US military used\\nweather data from the centre for planning its attack on Iraq in the\\nGulf War. The media report claimed that the attack had slowed down the\\nCray\\'s calculations, thus endangering the whole Desert Storm\\noperation. The paper announced the hackers had been `inadvertently\\njeopardising--almost fatally--the international effort against Saddam\\nHussein\\' and had put `thousands of servicemen\\'s lives at risk\\'.9\\n\\nFurther, the paper alleged that the US State Department was so\\nincensed about British hackers\\' repeated break-ins disrupting Pentagon\\ndefence planning that it had complained to Prime Minister John Major.\\nThe White House put the matter more bluntly than the State Department:\\nStop your hackers or we will cut off European access to our satellite\\nwhich provides trans-Atlantic data and voice telecommunications.\\nSomeone in Britain seemed to be listening, for less than twelve months\\nlater, authorities had arrested all three hackers.\\n\\nPad thought the allegations were rubbish. He had been inside a VAX\\nmachine at the weather centre for a couple of hours one night, but he\\nhad never touched a Cray there. He had certainly never done anything\\nto slow the machine down. No cracking programs, no scanners, nothing\\nwhich might account for the delay described in the report. Even if he\\nhad been responsible, he found it hard to believe the Western allies\\'\\nvictory in the Gulf War was determined by one computer in Berkshire.\\n\\nAll of which gave him cause to wonder why the media was running this\\nstory now, after Wandii\\'s acquittal but before he and Gandalf were\\nsentenced. Sour grapes, perhaps?\\n\\nFor days, columnists, editorial and letter writers across Britain\\npontificated on the meaning of the Wandii\\'s verdict and the validity\\nof an addiction to hacking as a defence. Some urged computer owners to\\ntake responsibility for securing their own systems. Others called for\\ntougher hacking laws. A few echoed the view of The Times, which\\ndeclared in an editorial, `a persistent car thief of [the hacker\\'s]\\nage would almost certainly have received a custodial sentence. Both\\ncrimes suggest disrespect for other people\\'s property ... the jurors\\nmay have failed to appreciate the seriousness of this kind of\\noffence\\'.10\\n\\nThe debate flew forward, changing and growing, and expanding beyond\\nBritain\\'s borders. In Hong Kong, the South China Morning Post asked,\\n`Is [this] case evidence of a new social phenomenon, with immature and\\nsusceptible minds being damaged through prolonged exposure to personal\\ncomputers?\\' The paper described public fear that Wandii\\'s case would\\nresult in `the green light for an army of computer-literate hooligans\\nto pillage the world\\'s databases at will, pleading insanity when\\ncaught\\'.11\\n\\nBy April Fool\\'s Day 1991, more than two weeks after the end of the\\ncourt case, Wandii had his own syndrome named after him, courtesy of\\nThe Guardian.\\n\\nAnd while Wandii, his mother and his team of lawyers celebrated their\\nvictory quietly, the media reported that the Scotland Yard detectives\\ncommiserated over their defeat, which was considerably more serious\\nthan simply losing the Wandii case. The Computer Crimes Unit was being\\n`reorganised\\'. Two experienced officers from the five-man unit were\\nbeing moved out of the group. The official line was that the\\n`rotations\\' were normal Scotland Yard procedure. The unofficial word\\nwas that the Wandii case had been a fiasco, wasting time and money,\\nand the debacle was not to be repeated.\\n\\nIn the north, a dark cloud gathered over Pad and Gandalf as their\\njudgment day approached. The Wandii case verdict might have been cause\\nfor celebration among some in the computer underground, but it brought\\nlittle joy for the other two 8lgm hackers.\\n\\nFor Pad and Gandalf, who had already pleaded guilty, Wandii\\'s\\nacquittal was a disaster.\\n\\n\\nOn 12 May 1993, two months after Wandii\\'s acquittal, Boris Kayser\\nstood up at the Bar table to put forward Electron\\'s case at the\\nAustralian hacker\\'s plea and sentencing hearing. As he began to speak,\\na hush fell over the Victorian County Court.\\n\\nA tall, burly man with a booming voice, an imperious courtroom\\ndemeanour and his traditional black robes flowing behind him in an\\necho of his often emphatic gesticulations, Kayser was larger than\\nlife. A master showman, he knew how to play an audience of courtroom\\njournalists sitting behind him as much as to the judge in front of\\nhim.\\n\\nElectron had already stood in the dock and pleaded guilty to fourteen\\ncharges, as agreed with the DPP\\'s office. In typical style, Kayser had\\ninterrupted the long process of the court clerk reading out each\\ncharge and asking whether Electron would plead guilty or not guilty.\\nWith an impatient wave of his hand, Kayser asked the judge to dispense\\nwith such formalities since his client would plead guilty to all the\\nagreed charges at once. The interjection was more of an announcement\\nthan a question.\\n\\nThe formalities of a plea having been summarily dealt with, the\\nquestion now at hand was sentencing. Electron wondered if he would be\\nsent to prison. Despite lobbying from Electron\\'s lawyers, the DPP\\'s\\noffice had refused to recommend a non-custodial sentence. The best\\ndeal Electron\\'s lawyers had been able to arrange in exchange for\\nturning Crown witness was for the DPP to remain silent on the issue of\\nprison. The judge would make up his mind without input from the DPP.\\n\\nElectron fiddled nervously with his father\\'s wedding ring, which he\\nwore on his right hand. After his father\\'s death, Electron\\'s sister\\nhad begun taking things from the family home. Electron didn\\'t care\\nmuch because there were only two things he really wanted: that ring\\nand some of his father\\'s paintings.\\n\\nKayser called a handful of witnesses to support the case for a light\\nsentence. Electron\\'s grandmother from Queensland. The family friend\\nwho had driven Electron to the hospital the day his father died.\\nElectron\\'s psychiatrist, the eminent Lester Walton. Walton in\\nparticular highlighted the difference between the two possible paths\\nforward: prison, which would certainly traumatise an already mentally\\nunstable young man, or freedom, which offered Electron a good chance\\nof eventually establishing a normal life.\\n\\nWhen Kayser began summarising the case for a non-custodial sentence,\\nElectron could hear the pack of journalists off to his side\\nfrantically scribbling notes. He wanted to look at them, but he was\\nafraid the judge would see his ponytail, carefully tucked into his\\nneatly ironed white shirt, if he turned sideways,\\n\\n`Your Honour,\\' Kayser glanced backward slightly, toward the court\\nreporters, as he warmed up, `my client lived in an artificial world of\\nelectronic pulses.\\'\\n\\nScratch, scribble. Electron could almost predict, within half a\\nsecond, when the journalists\\' pencils and pens would reach a crescendo\\nof activity. The ebb and flow of Boris\\'s boom was timed in the style\\nof a TV newsreader.\\n\\nKayser said his client was addicted to the computer the way an\\nalcoholic was obsessed with the bottle. More scratching, and lots of\\nit. This client, Kayser thundered, had never sought to damage any\\nsystem, steal money or make a profit. He was not malicious in the\\nleast, he was merely playing a game.\\n\\n`I think,\\' Electron\\'s barrister concluded passionately, but slowly\\nenough for every journalist to get it down on paper, `that he should\\nhave been called Little Jack Horner, who put in his thumb, pulled out\\na plumb and said, \"What a good boy am I!\"\\'\\n\\nNow came the wait. The judge retired to his chambers to weigh up the\\npre-sentence report, Electron\\'s family situation, the fact that he had\\nturned Crown witness, his offences--everything. Electron had given a\\nnine-page written statement against Phoenix to the prosecution. If the\\nPhoenix case went to trial, Electron would be put on the stand to back\\nup that statement.\\n\\nIn the month before Electron returned to court to hear his sentence,\\nhe thought about how he could have fought the case. Some of the\\ncharges were dubious.\\n\\nIn one case, he had been charged with illegally accessing public\\ninformation through a public account. He had accessed the anonymous\\nFTP server at the University of Helsinki to copy information about\\nDES. His first point of access had been through a hacked Melbourne\\nUniversity account.\\n\\nBeat that charge, Electron\\'s lawyer had told him, and there\\'s plenty\\nmore where that came from. The DPP had good pickings and could make up\\na new charge for another site. Still, Electron reasoned some of the\\nCrown\\'s evidence would not have stood up under cross-examination.\\n\\nWhen reporters from Australia and overseas called NASA headquarters\\nfor comment on the hacker-induced network shutdown, the agency\\nresponded that it had no idea what they were talking about. There had\\nbeen no NASA network shutdown. A spokesman made inquiries and, he\\nassured the media, NASA was puzzled by the report. Sharon Beskenis\\'s\\nstatement didn\\'t seem so watertight after all. She was not, it turned\\nout, even a NASA employee but a contractor from Lockheed.\\n\\nDuring that month-long wait, Electron had trouble living down Kayser\\'s\\nnursery-rhyme rendition in the courtroom. When he rang friends, they\\nwould open the conversation saying, `Oh, is that Little Jack Horner?\\'\\n\\nThey had all seen the nightly news, featuring Kayser and his client.\\nKayser had looked grave leaving court, while Electron, wearing John\\nLennon-style glasses with dark lenses and with his shoulder-length\\ncurls pulled tightly back in a ponytail, had tried to smile at the\\ncamera crews. But his small, fine features and smattering of freckles\\ndisappeared under the harsh camera lights, so much so that the black,\\nround spectacles seemed almost to float on a blank, white surface.\\n\\nThe week after Electron pleaded guilty in Australia, Pad and Gandalf\\nsat side by side in London\\'s Southwark dock one last time.\\n\\nFor a day and a half, beginning on 20 May 1993, the two hackers\\nlistened to their lawyers argue their defence. Yes, our clients hacked\\ncomputers, they told the judge, but the offences were nowhere near as\\nserious as the prosecution wants to paint them. The lawyers were\\nfighting hard for one thing: to keep Pad and Gandalf out of prison.\\n\\nSome of the hearing was tough going for the two hackers, but not just\\nbecause of any sense of foreboding caused by the judge\\'s imminent\\ndecision. The problem was that Gandalf made Pad laugh, and it didn\\'t\\nlook at all good to laugh in the middle of your sentencing hearing.\\nSitting next to Gandalf for hours on end, while lawyers from both\\nsides butchered the technical aspects of computer hacking which the\\n8lgm hackers had spent years learning, did it. Pad had only to give\\nGandalf a quick sidelong glance and he quickly found himself\\nswallowing and clearing his throat to keep from bursting into\\nlaughter. Gandalf\\'s irrepressible irreverence was written all over his\\nface.\\n\\nThe stern-faced Judge Harris could send them to jail, but he still\\nwouldn\\'t understand. Like the gaggle of lawyers bickering at the front\\nof the courtroom, the judge was--and would always be--out of the loop.\\nNone of them had any idea what was really going on inside the heads of\\nthe two hackers. None of them could ever understand what hacking was\\nall about--the thrill of stalking a quarry or of using your wits to\\noutsmart so-called experts; the pleasure of finally penetrating a\\nmuch-desired machine and knowing that system is yours; the deep\\nanti-establishment streak which served as a well-centred ballast\\nagainst the most violent storms washing in from the outside world; and\\nthe camaraderie of the international hacking community on Altos.\\n\\nThe lawyers could talk about it, could put experts on the stand and\\npsychological reports in the hands of the judge, but none of them\\nwould ever really comprehend because they had never experienced it.\\nThe rest of the courtroom was out of the loop, and Pad and Gandalf\\nstared out from the dock as if looking through a two-way mirror from a\\nsecret, sealed room.\\n\\nPad\\'s big worry had been this third charge--the one which he faced\\nalone. At his plea hearing, he had admitted to causing damage to a\\nsystem owned by what was, in 1990, called the Polytechnic of Central\\nLondon. He hadn\\'t damaged the machine by, say, erasing files, but the\\nother side had claimed that the damages totalled about [sterling]250\\n000.\\n\\nThe hacker was sure there was zero chance the polytechnic had spent\\nanything near that amount. He had a reasonable idea of how long it\\nwould take someone to clean up his intrusions. But if the prosecution\\ncould convince a judge to accept that figure, the hacker might be\\nlooking at a long prison term.\\n\\nPad had already braced himself for the possibility of prison. His\\nlawyer warned him before the sentencing date that there was a\\nreasonable likelihood the two 8lgm hackers would be sent down. After\\nthe Wandii case, the public pressure to `correct\\' a `wrong\\' decision\\nby the Wandii jury was enormous. The police had described Wandii\\'s\\nacquittal as `a licence to hack\\'--and The Times, had run the\\nstatement.12 It was likely the judge, who had presided over Wandii\\'s\\ntrial, would want to send a loud and clear message to the hacking\\ncommunity.\\n\\nPad thought that perhaps, if he and Gandalf had pleaded not guilty\\nalongside Wandii, they would have been acquitted. But there was no way\\nPad would have subjected himself to the kind of public humiliation\\nWandii went through during the `addicted to computers\\' evidence. The\\nmedia appeared to want to paint the three hackers as pallid, scrawny,\\nsocially inept, geeky geniuses, and to a large degree Wandii\\'s lawyers\\nhad worked off this desire. Pad didn\\'t mind being viewed as highly\\nintelligent, but he wasn\\'t a geek. He had a casual girlfriend. He went\\nout dancing with friends or to hear bands in Manchester\\'s thriving\\nalternative music scene. He worked out his upper body with weights at\\nhome. Shy--yes. A geek--no.\\n\\nCould Pad have made a case for being addicted to hacking? Yes,\\nalthough he never believed that he had been. Completely enthralled,\\nentirely entranced? Maybe. Suffering from a passing obsession?\\nPerhaps. But addicted? No, he didn\\'t think so. Besides, who knew for\\nsure if a defence of addiction could have saved him from the\\nprosecution\\'s claim anyway?\\n\\nExactly where the quarter of a million pound claim came from in the\\nfirst place was a mystery to Pad. The police had just said it to him,\\nas if it was fact, in the police interview. Pad hadn\\'t seen any proof,\\nbut that hadn\\'t stopped him from spending a great deal of time feeling\\nvery stressed about how the judge would view the matter.\\n\\nThe only answer seemed to be some good, independent technical advice.\\nAt the request of both Pad and Gandalf\\'s lawyers, Dr Peter Mills, of\\nManchester University, and Dr Russell Lloyd, of London Business\\nSchool, had examined a large amount of technical evidence presented in\\nthe prosecution\\'s papers. In an independent report running to more\\nthan 23 pages, the experts stated that the hackers had caused less\\nhavoc than the prosecution alleged. In addition, Pad\\'s solicitor asked\\nDr Mills to specifically review, in a separate report, the evidence\\nsupporting the prosecution\\'s large damage claim.\\n\\nDr Mills stated that one of the police expert witnesses, a British\\nTelecom employee, had said that Digital recommended a full rebuild of\\nthe system at the earliest possible opportunity--and at considerable\\ncost. However, the BT expert had not stated that the cost was\\n[sterling]250000 nor even mentioned if the cost quote which had been\\ngiven had actually been accepted.\\n\\nIn fact, Dr Mills concluded that there was no supporting evidence at\\nall for the quarter of a million pound claim. Not only that, but any\\ntest of reason based on the evidence provided by the prosecution\\nshowed the claim to be completely ridiculous.\\n\\nIn a separate report, Dr Mills\\' stated that:\\n\\ni) The machine concerned was a Vax 6320, this is quite a powerful\\n`mainframe\\' system and could support several hundreds of users.\\n\\nii) That a full dump of files takes 6 tapes, however since the type of\\ntape is not specified this gives no real indication of the size of the\\nfilesystem. A tape could vary from 0.2 Gigabytes to 2.5 Gigabytes.\\n\\niii) The machine was down for three days.\\n\\nWith this brief information it is difficult to give an accurate cost\\nfor restoring the machine, however an over estimate would be:\\n\\ni) Time spent in restoring the system, 10 man days at [sterling]300\\nper day; [sterling]3000.\\n\\nii) Lost time by users, 30 man days at [sterling]300 per day;\\n[sterling]9000.\\n\\nThe total cost in my opinion is unlikely to be higher than\\n[sterling]12000 and this itself is probably a rather high estimate. I\\ncertainly cannot see how a figure of [sterling]250000 could be\\njustified.\\n\\nIt looked to Pad that the prosecution\\'s claim was not for damage at\\nall. It was for properly securing the system--an entirely rebuilt\\nsystem. It seemed to him that the police were trying to put the cost\\nof securing the polytechnic\\'s entire computer network onto the\\nshoulders of one hacker--and to call it damages. In fact, Pad\\ndiscovered, the polytechnic had never actually even spent the\\n[sterling]250000.\\n\\nPad was hopeful, but he was also angry. All along, the police had been\\nthreatening him with this huge damage bill. He had tossed and turned\\nin his bed at night worrying about it. And, in the end, the figure put\\nforward for so long as fact was nothing but an outrageous claim based\\non not a single shred of solid evidence.\\n\\nUsing Dr Mills\\'s report, Pad\\'s barrister, Mukhtar Hussain, QC,\\nnegotiated privately with the prosecution barrister, who finally\\nrelented and agreed to reduce the damage estimate to [sterling]15000.\\nIt was, in Pad\\'s view, still far too high, but it was much better than\\n[sterling]250000. He was in no mind to look a gift horse in the mouth.\\n\\nJudge Harris accepted the revised damage estimate.\\n\\nThe prosecution may have lost ground on the damage bill, but it wasn\\'t\\ngiving up the fight. These two hackers, James Richardson told the\\ncourt and journalists during the two-day sentencing hearing, had\\nhacked into some 10000 computer systems around the world. They were\\ninside machines or networks in at least fifteen countries. Russia.\\nIndia. France. Norway. Germany. The US. Canada. Belgium. Sweden.\\nItaly. Taiwan. Singapore. Iceland. Australia. Officers on the case\\nsaid the list of the hackers\\' targets `read like an atlas\\', Richardson\\ntold the court.\\n\\nPad listened to the list. It sounded about right. What didn\\'t sound\\nright were the allegations that he or Gandalf had crashed Sweden\\'s\\ntelephone network by running an X.25 scanner over its packet network.\\nThe crash had forced a Swedish government minister to apologise on\\ntelevision. The police said the minister did not identify the true\\ncause of the problem--the British hackers--in his public apology.\\n\\nPad had no idea what they were talking about. He hadn\\'t done anything\\nlike that to the Swedish phone system, and as far as he knew, neither\\nhad Gandalf.\\n\\nSomething else didn\\'t sound right. Richardson told the court that in\\ntotal, the two hackers had racked up at least [sterling]25000 in phone\\nbills for unsuspecting legitimate customers, and caused `damage\\' to\\nsystems which was very conservatively estimated at almost\\n[sterling]123000.\\n\\nWhere were these guys getting these numbers from? Pad marvelled at\\ntheir cheek. He had been through the evidence with a fine-toothed\\ncomb, yet he had not seen one single bill showing what a site had\\nactually paid to repair `damage\\' caused by the hackers. The figures\\ntossed around by the police and the prosecution weren\\'t real bills;\\nthey weren\\'t cast in iron.\\n\\nFinally, on Friday 21 May, after all the evidence had been presented,\\nthe judge adjourned the court to consider sentencing. When he returned\\nto the bench fifteen minutes later, Pad knew what was going to happen\\nfrom the judge\\'s face. To the hacker, the expression said: I am going\\nto give you everything that Wandii should have got.\\n\\nJudge Harris echoed The Times\\'s sentiments when he told the two\\ndefendants, `If your passion had been cars rather than computers, we\\nwould have called your conduct delinquent, and I don\\'t shrink from the\\nanalogy of describing what you were doing as intellectual joyriding.\\n\\n`Hacking is not harmless. Computers now form a central role in our\\nlives. Some, providing emergency services, depend on their computers\\nto deliver those services.\\'13\\n\\nHackers needed to be given a clear signal that computer crime `will\\nnot and cannot be tolerated\\', the judge said, adding that he had\\nthought long and hard before handing down sentence. He accepted that\\nneither hacker had intended to cause damage, but it was imperative to\\nprotect society\\'s computer systems and he would be failing in his\\npublic duty if he didn\\'t sentence the two hackers to a prison term of\\nsix months.\\n\\nJudge Harris told the hackers that he had chosen a custodial sentence,\\n`both to penalise you for what you have done and for the losses\\ncaused, and to deter others who might be similarly tempted\\'.\\n\\nThis was the show trial, not Wandii\\'s case, Pad thought as the court\\nofficers led him and Gandalf out of the dock, down to the prisoner\\'s\\nlift behind the courtroom and into a jail cell.\\n\\nLess than two weeks after Pad and Gandalf were sentenced, Electron was\\nback in the Victorian County Court to discover his own fate.\\n\\nAs he stood in the dock on 3 June 1993 he felt numb, as emotionally\\nremoved from the scene as Meursault in Camus\\' L\\'etranger. He believed\\nhe was handling the stress pretty well until he experienced tunnel\\nvision while watching the judge read his penalty. He perused the room\\nbut saw neither Phoenix nor Nom.\\n\\nWhen Judge Anthony Smith summarised the charges, he seemed to have a\\nspecial interest in count number 13--the Zardoz charge. A few minutes\\ninto reading the sentence, the judge said, `In my view, a custodial\\nsentence is appropriate for each of the offences constituted by the\\n12th, 13th and 14th counts\\'. They were the `knowingly concerned\\'\\ncharges, with Phoenix, involving NASA, LLNL and CSIRO. Electron looked\\naround the courtroom. People turned back to stare at him. Their eyes\\nsaid, `You are going to prison\\'.\\n\\n`I formed the view that a custodial sentence is appropriate in respect\\nof each of these offences because of the seriousness of them,\\' Judge\\nSmith noted, `and having regard to the need to demonstrate that the\\ncommunity will not tolerate this type of offence.\\n\\n`Our society today is ... increasingly ... dependent upon the use of\\ncomputer technology. Conduct of the kind in which you engaged poses a\\nthreat to the usefulness of that technology ... It is incumbent upon\\nthe courts ... to see to it that the sentences they impose reflect the\\ngravity of this kind of criminality.\\n\\n`On each of Counts 12, 13 and 14, you are convicted and you are\\nsentenced to a term of imprisonment of six months ... each ... to be\\nconcurrent.\\'\\n\\nThe judge paused, then continued, `And ... I direct, by order, that\\nyou be released forthwith upon your giving security by recognisance\\n... in the sum of $500 ... You will not be required to serve the terms\\nof imprisonment imposed, provided you are of good behaviour for the\\nensuing six months.\\' He then ordered Electron to complete 300 hours of\\ncommunity service, and to submit to psychiatric assessment and\\ntreatment.\\n\\nElectron breathed a sigh of relief.\\n\\nWhen outlining the mitigating circumstances which led to suspension of\\nthe jail sentence, Judge Smith described Electron as being addicted to\\nusing his computer `in much the same way as an alcoholic becomes\\naddicted to the bottle\\'. Boris Kayser had used the analogy in the\\nsentencing hearing, perhaps for the\\nbenefit of the media, but the judge had obviously been swayed by his\\nview.\\n\\nWhen court adjourned, Electron left the dock and shook hands with his\\nlawyers. After three years, he was almost free of his court problems.\\nThere was only one possible reason he might need to return to court.\\n\\nIf Phoenix fought out his case in a full criminal trial, the DPP would\\nput Electron on the stand to testify against him. It would be an ugly\\nscene.\\n\\nThe inmates of HM Prison Kirkham, on the north-west coast of England,\\nnear Preston, had heard all about Pad and Gandalf by the time they\\narrived. They greeted the hackers by name. They\\'d seen the reports on\\ntelly, especially about how Gandalf had hacked NASA--complete with\\nfootage of the space shuttle taking off. Some TV reporter\\'s idea of\\nsubtle irony--`Two hackers were sent down today\\' as the space shuttle\\nwent up.\\n\\nKirkham was far better than Brixton, where the hackers had spent the\\nfirst days of their sentence while awaiting transfer. Brixton was what\\nPad always envisioned prison would look like, with floors of barred\\ncells facing onto an open centre and prisoners only allowed out of\\ntheir cells for scheduled events such as time in the yard. It was a\\nplace where hard-core criminals lived. Fortunately, Pad and Gandalf\\nhad been placed in the same cell while they waited to be assigned to\\ntheir final destination.\\n\\nAfter ten days inside Brixton Pad and Gandalf were led from their\\ncell, handcuffed and put in a coach heading toward the windy west\\ncoast.\\n\\nDuring the drive, Pad kept looking down at his hand, locked in shiny\\nsteel to Gandalf\\'s hand, then he looked back up again at his fellow\\nhacker. Clearing his throat and turning away from Gandalf\\'s difficult\\ngrin--his friend now on the edge of laughing himself--Pad struggled.\\nHe tried to hold down the muscles of his face, to pull them back from\\nlaughter.\\n\\nA minimum security prison holding up to 632 prisoners, Kirkham looked\\nvaguely like a World War II RAF base with a large collection of\\nfree-standing buildings around the grounds. There were no real walls,\\njust a small wire fence which Pad soon learned prisoners routinely\\njumped when the place started to get to them.\\n\\nFor a prison, Kirkham was pretty good. There was a duck pond, a\\nbowling green, a sort of mini-cinema which showed films in the early\\nevenings, eight pay phones, a football field, a cricket pavilion and,\\nbest of all, lots of fields. Prisoners could have visits on weekday\\nafternoons between 1.10 and 3.40, or on the weekend.\\n\\nLuck smiled on the two hackers. They were assigned to the same billet\\nand, since none of the other prisoners objected, they became\\nroom-mates. Since they were sentenced in May, they would serve their\\ntime during summer. If they were `of good behaviour\\' and didn\\'t get\\ninto trouble with other prisoners, they would be out in three months.\\n\\nLike any prison, Kirkham had its share of prisoners who didn\\'t get\\nalong with each other. Mostly, prisoners wanted to know what you were\\nin for and, more particularly, if you had been convicted of a sex\\ncrime. They didn\\'t like sex crime offenders and Pad heard about a pack\\nof Kirkham prisoners who dragged one of their own, screaming, to a\\ntree, where they tried to hang him for being a suspected rapist. In\\nfact, the prisoner hadn\\'t been convicted of anything like rape. He had\\nsimply refused to pay his poll tax.\\n\\nFortunately for Pad and Gandalf, everyone else in Kirkham knew why\\nthey were there. At the end of their first week they returned to their\\nroom one afternoon to find a sign painted above their door. It said,\\n`NASA HQ\\'.\\n\\nThe other minimum security prisoners understood hacking--and they had\\nall sorts of ideas about how you could make money from it. Most of the\\nprisoners in Kirkham were in for petty theft, credit card fraud, and\\nother small-time crimes. There was also a phreaker, who arrived the\\nsame day as Pad and Gandalf. He landed eight months in prison--two\\nmore than the 8lgm hackers--and Pad wondered what kind of message that\\nsent the underground.\\n\\nDespite their best efforts, the 8lgm twosome didn\\'t fit quite the\\nprison mould. In the evenings, other prisoners spent their free time\\nshooting pool or taking drugs. In the bedroom down the hall, Gandalf\\nlounged on his bed studying a book on VMS internals. Pad read a\\ncomputer magazine and listened to some indie music--often his `Babes\\nin Toyland\\' tape. In a parody of prison movies, the two hackers marked\\noff their days inside the prison with cross-hatched lines on their\\nbedroom wall--four marks, then a diagonal line through them. They\\nwrote other things on the walls too.\\n\\nThe long, light-filled days of summer flowed one into the other, as\\nPad and Gandalf fell into the rhythm of the prison. The morning\\ncheck-in at 8.30 to make sure none of the prisoners had gone\\nwalkabout. The dash across the bowling green for a breakfast of beans,\\nbacon, eggs, toast and sausage. The walk to the greenhouses where the\\ntwo hackers had been assigned for work detail.\\n\\nThe work wasn\\'t hard. A little digging in the pots. Weeding around the\\nbaby lettuce heads, watering the green peppers and transplanting\\ntomato seedlings. When the greenhouses became too warm by late\\nmorning, Pad and Gandalf wandered outside for a bit of air. They often\\ntalked about girls, cracking crude, boyish jokes about women and\\noccasionally discussing their girlfriends more seriously. As the heat\\nsettled in, they sat down, lounging against the side of the\\ngreenhouse.\\n\\nAfter lunch, followed by more time in the greenhouse, Pad and Gandalf\\nsometimes went off for walks in the fields surrounding the prison.\\nFirst the football field, then the paddocks dotted with cows beyond\\nit.\\n\\nPad was a likeable fellow, largely because of his easygoing style and\\nrelaxed sense of humour. But liking him wasn\\'t the same as knowing\\nhim, and the humour often deflected deeper probing into his\\npersonality. But Gandalf knew him, understood him. Everything was so\\neasy with Gandalf. During the long, sunny walks, the conversation\\nflowed as easily as the light breeze through the grass.\\n\\nAs they wandered in the fields, Pad often wore his denim jacket. Most\\nof the clothes on offer from the prison clothing office were drab\\nblue, but Pad had lucked onto this wonderful, cool denim jacket which\\nhe took to wearing all the time.\\n\\nWalking for hours on end along the perimeters of the prison grounds,\\nPad saw how easy it would be to escape, but in the end there didn\\'t\\nseem to be much point. They way he saw it, the police would just catch\\nyou and put you back in again. Then you\\'d have to serve extra time.\\n\\nOnce a week, Pad\\'s parents came to visit him, but the few precious\\nhours of visiting time were more for his parents\\' benefit than his\\nown. He reassured them that he was OK, and when they looked him in the\\nface and saw it was true, they stopped worrying quite so much. They\\nbrought him news from home, including the fact that his computer\\nequipment had been returned by one of the police who had been in the\\noriginal raid.\\n\\nThe officer asked Pad\\'s mother how the hacker was doing in prison.\\n`Very well indeed,\\' she told him. `Prison\\'s not nearly so bad as he\\nthought.\\' The officer\\'s face crumpled into a disappointed frown. He\\nseemed to be looking for news that Pad was suffering nothing but\\nmisery.\\n\\nAt the end of almost three months, with faces well tanned from walking\\nin the meadows, Pad and Gandalf walked free.\\n\\n\\nTo the casual witness sitting nearby in the courtroom, the tension\\nbetween Phoenix\\'s mother and father was almost palpable. They were not\\nsitting near each other but that didn\\'t mitigate the silent hostility\\nwhich rose through the air like steam. Phoenix\\'s divorced parents\\nprovided a stark contrast to Nom\\'s adopted parents, an older, suburban\\ncouple who were very much married.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, 25 August 1993 Phoenix and Nom pleaded guilty to fifteen\\nand two charges respectively. The combined weight of the prosecution\\'s\\nevidence, the risk and cost of running a full trial and the need to\\nget on with their lives had pushed them over the edge. Electron didn\\'t\\nneed to come to court to give evidence.\\n\\nAt the plea hearing, which ran over to the next day, Phoenix\\'s lawyer,\\nDyson Hore-Lacy, spent considerable time sketching the messy divorce\\nof his client\\'s parents for the benefit of the judge. Suggesting\\nPhoenix retreated into his computer during the bitter separation and\\ndivorce was the best chance of getting him off a prison term. Most of\\nall, the defence presented Phoenix as a young man who had strayed off\\nthe correct path in life but was now back on track--holding down a job\\nand having a life.\\n\\nThe DPP had gone in hard against Phoenix. They seemed to want a jail\\nterm badly and they doggedly presented Phoenix as an arrogant\\nbraggart. The court heard a tape-recording of Phoenix ringing up\\nsecurity guru Edward DeHart of the Computer Emergency Response Team at\\nCarnegie Mellon University to brag about a security exploit. Phoenix\\ntold DeHart to get onto his computer and then proceeded to walk him\\nstep by step through the `passwd -f\\' security bug. Ironically, it was\\nElectron who had discovered that security hole and taught it to\\nPhoenix--a fact Phoenix didn\\'t seem to want to mention to DeHart.\\n\\nThe head of the AFP\\'s Southern Region Computer Crimes Unit, Detective\\nSergeant Ken Day was in court that day. There was no way he was going\\nto miss this. The same witness noting the tension between Phoenix\\'s\\nparents might also have perceived an undercurrent of hostility between\\nDay and Phoenix--an undercurrent which did not seem to exist between\\nDay and either of the other Realm hackers.\\n\\nDay, a short, careful man who gave off an air of bottled intensity,\\nseemed to have an acute dislike for Phoenix. By all observations the\\nfeeling was mutual. A cool-headed professional, Day would never say\\nanything in public to express the dislike--that was not his style. His\\ndislike was only indicated by a slight tightness in the muscles of an\\notherwise unreadable face.\\n\\nOn 6 October 1993, Phoenix and Nom stood side by side in the dock for\\nsentencing. Wearing a stern expression, Judge Smith began by detailing\\nboth the hackers\\' charges and the origin of The Realm. But after the\\nsummary, the judge saved his harshest rebuke for Phoenix.\\n\\n`There is nothing ... to admire about your conduct and every reason\\nwhy it should be roundly condemned. You pointed out [weaknesses] to\\nsome of the system administrators ... [but] this was more a display of\\narrogance and a demonstration of what you thought was your superiority\\nrather than an act of altruism on your part.\\n\\n`You ... bragged about what you had done or were going to do ... Your\\nconduct revealed ... arrogance on your part, open defiance, and an\\nintention to the beat the system. [You] did cause havoc for a time\\nwithin the various targeted systems.\\'\\n\\nAlthough the judge appeared firm in his views while passing sentence,\\nbehind the scenes he had agonised greatly over his decision. He had\\nattempted to balance what he saw as the need for deterrence, the\\ncreation of a precedence for sentencing hacking cases in Australia,\\nand the individual aspects of this case. Finally, after sifting\\nthrough the arguments again and again, he had reached a decision.\\n\\n`I have no doubt that some sections of our community would regard\\nanything than a custodial sentence as less than appropriate. I share\\nthat view. But after much reflection ... I have concluded that an\\nimmediate term of imprisonment is unnecessary.\\'\\n\\nRelief rolled across the faces of the hackers\\' friends and relatives\\nas the judge ordered Phoenix to complete 500 hours of community\\nservice work over two years and assigned him a $1000 twelve-month good\\nbehaviour bond. He gave Nom 200 hours, and a $500, six-month bond for\\ngood behaviour.\\n\\nAs Phoenix was leaving the courtroom, a tall, skinny young man, loped\\ndown the aisle towards him.\\n\\n`Congratulations,\\' the stranger said, his long hair dangling in\\ndelicate curls around his shoulders.\\n\\n`Thanks,\\' Phoenix answered, combing his memory for the boyish face\\nwhich couldn\\'t be any older than his own. `Do I know you?\\'\\n\\n`Sort of,\\' the stranger answered. `I\\'m Mendax. I\\'m about to go through\\nwhat you did, but worse.\\'\\n\\n          ',\n",
       " \" 8 -- The International Subversives.\\n\\n\\nAll around; an eerie sound.\\n\\n-- from `Maralinga', 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.\\n\\nPrime Suspect rang Mendax, offering an adventure. He had discovered a\\nstrange system called NMELH1 (pronounced N-Melly-H-1) and it was time\\nto go exploring. He read off the dial-up numbers, found in a list of\\nmodem phone numbers on another hacked system.\\n\\nMendax looked at the scrap of paper in his hand, thinking about the\\nname of the computer system.\\n\\nThe `N' stood for Northern Telecom, a Canadian company with annual\\nsales of $8 billion. NorTel, as the company was known, sold thousands\\nof highly sophisticated switches and other telephone exchange\\nequipment to some of the world's largest phone companies. The `Melly'\\nundoubtedly referred to the fact that the system was in Melbourne. As\\nfor the `H-1', well, that was anyone's guess, but Mendax figured it\\nprobably stood for `host-1'--meaning computer site number one.\\n\\nPrime Suspect had stirred Mendax's interest. Mendax had spent hours\\nexperimenting with commands inside the computers which controlled\\ntelephone exchanges. In the end, those forays were all just\\nguesswork--trial and error learning, at considerable risk of\\ndiscovery. Unlike making a mistake inside a single computer,\\nmis-guessing a command inside a telephone exchange in downtown Sydney\\nor Melbourne could take down a whole prefix--10000 or more phone\\nlines--and cause instant havoc.\\n\\nThis was exactly what the International Subversives didn't want to do.\\nThe three IS hackers--Mendax, Prime Suspect and Trax--had seen what\\nhappened to the visible members of the computer underground in England\\nand in Australia. The IS hackers had three very good reasons to keep\\ntheir activities quiet.\\n\\nPhoenix. Nom. And Electron.\\n\\nBut, Mendax thought, what if you could learn about how to manipulate a\\nmillion-dollar telephone exchange by reading\\nthe manufacturer's technical documentation? How high was\\nthe chance that those documents, which weren't available to the\\npublic, were stored inside NorTel's computer network?\\n\\nBetter still, what if he could find NorTel's original source code--the\\nsoftware designed to control specific telephone switches, such as the\\nDMS-100 model. That code might be sitting on a computer hooked into\\nthe worldwide NorTel network. A hacker with access could insert his\\nown backdoor--a hidden security flaw--before the company sent out\\nsoftware to its customers.\\n\\nWith a good technical understanding of how NorTel's equipment worked,\\ncombined with a backdoor installed in every piece of software shipped\\nwith a particular product, you could have control over every new\\nNorTel DMS telephone switch installed from Boston to Bahrain. What\\npower! Mendax thought, what if you you could turn off 10000 phones in\\nRio de Janeiro, or give 5000 New Yorkers free calls one afternoon, or\\nlisten into private telephone conversations in Brisbane. The\\ntelecommunications world would be your oyster.\\n\\nLike their predecessors, the three IS hackers had started out in the\\nMelbourne BBS scene. Mendax met Trax on Electric Dreams in about 1988,\\nand Prime Suspect on Megaworks, where he used the handle Control\\nReset, not long after that. When he set up his own BBS at his home in\\nTecoma, a hilly suburb so far out of Melbourne that it was practically\\nin forest, he invited both hackers to visit `A Cute Paranoia' whenever\\nthey could get through on the single phone line.\\n\\nVisiting on Mendax's BBS suited both hackers, for it was more private\\nthan other BBSes. Eventually they exchanged home telephone numbers,\\nbut only to talk modem-to-modem. For months, they would ring each\\nother up and type on their computer screens to each other--never\\nhaving heard the sound of the other person's voice. Finally, late in\\n1990, the nineteen-year-old Mendax called up the 24-year-old Trax for\\na voice chat. In early 1991, Mendax and Prime Suspect, aged seventeen,\\nalso began speaking in voice on the phone.\\n\\nTrax seemed slightly eccentric, and possibly suffered from some sort\\nof anxiety disorder. He refused to travel to the city, and he once\\nmade reference to seeing a psychiatrist. But Mendax usually found the\\nmost interesting people were a little unusual, and Trax was both.\\n\\nMendax and Trax discovered they had a few things in common. Both came\\nfrom poor but educated families, and both lived in the outer suburbs.\\nHowever, they had very different childhoods.\\n\\nTrax's parents migrated to Australia from Europe. Both his father, a\\nretired computer technician, and his mother spoke with a German\\naccent. Trax's father was very much the head of the household, and\\nTrax was his only son.\\n\\nBy contrast, by the time he was fifteen Mendax had lived in a dozen\\ndifferent places including Perth, Magnetic Island, Brisbane,\\nTownsville, Sydney, the Adelaide Hills, and a string of coastal towns\\nin northern New South Wales and Western Australia. In fifteen years he\\nhad enrolled in at least as many different schools.\\n\\nHis mother had left her Queensland home at age seventeen, after saving\\nenough money from selling her paintings to buy a motorcycle, a tent\\nand a road map of Australia. Waving goodbye to her stunned parents,\\nboth academics, she rode off into the sunset. Some 2000 kilometres\\nlater, she arrived in Sydney and joined the thriving counter-culture\\ncommunity. She worked as an artist and fell in love with a rebellious\\nyoung man she met at an anti-Vietnam demonstration.\\n\\nWithin a year of Mendax's birth, his mother's relationship with his\\nfather had ended. When Mendax was two, she married a fellow artist.\\nWhat followed was many turbulent years, moving from town to town as\\nhis parents explored the '70s left-wing, bohemian subculture. As a\\nboy, he was surrounded by artists. His stepfather staged and directed\\nplays and his mother did make-up, costume and set design.\\n\\nOne night in Adelaide, when Mendax was about four, his mother and a\\nfriend were returning from a meeting of anti-nuclear protesters. The\\nfriend claimed to have scientific evidence that the British had\\nconducted high-yield, above-ground nuclear tests at Maralinga, a\\ndesert area in north-west South Australia.\\n\\nA 1984 Royal Commission subsequently revealed that between 1953 and\\n1963 the British government had tested nuclear bombs at the site,\\nforcing more than 5000 Aborigines from their native lands. In December\\n1993, after years of stalling, the British government agreed to pay\\n[sterling]20 million toward cleaning up the more than 200 square\\nkilometres of contaminated lands. Back in 1968, however, the Menzies\\ngovernment had signed away Britain's responsibility to clean up the\\nsite. In the 1970s, the Australian government was still in denial\\nabout exactly what had happened at Maralinga.\\n\\nAs Mendax's mother and her friend drove through an Adelaide suburb\\ncarrying early evidence of the Maralinga tragedy, they noticed they\\nwere being followed by an unmarked car. They tried to lose the tail,\\nwithout success. The friend, nervous, said he had to get the data to\\nan Adelaide journalist before the police could stop him. Mendax's\\nmother quickly slipped into a back lane and the friend leapt from the\\ncar. She drove off, taking the police tail with her.\\n\\nThe plain-clothed police pulled her over shortly after, searched her\\ncar and demanded to know where her friend had gone and what had\\noccurred at the meeting. When she was less than helpful, one officer\\ntold her, `You have a child out at 2 in the morning. I think you\\nshould get out of politics, lady. It could be said you were an unfit\\nmother'.\\n\\nA few days after this thinly veiled threat, her friend showed up at\\nMendax's mother's house, covered in fading bruises. He said the police\\nhad beaten him up, then set him up by planting hash on him. `I'm\\ngetting out of politics,' he announced.\\n\\nHowever, she and her husband continued their involvement in theatre.\\nThe young Mendax never dreamed of running away to join the circus--he\\nalready lived the life of a travelling minstrel. But although the\\nactor-director was a good stepfather, he was also an alcoholic. Not\\nlong after Mendax's ninth birthday, his parents separated and then\\ndivorced.\\n\\nMendax's mother then entered a tempestuous relationship with an\\namateur musician. Mendax was frightened of the man, whom he considered\\na manipulative and violent psychopath. He had five different\\nidentities with plastic in his wallet to match. His whole background\\nwas a fabrication, right down to the country of his birth. When the\\nrelationship ended, the steady pattern of moving around the\\ncountryside began again, but this journey had a very different flavour\\nfrom the earlier happy-go-lucky odyssey. This time, Mendax and his\\nfamily were on the run from a physically abusive de facto. Finally,\\nafter hiding under assumed names on both sides of the continent,\\nMendax and his family settled on the outskirts of Melbourne.\\n\\nMendax left home at seventeen because he had received a tip-off about\\nan impending raid. Mendax wiped his disks, burnt his print-outs and\\nleft. A week later, the Victorian CIB turned up and searched his room,\\nbut found nothing. He married his girlfriend, an intelligent but\\nintroverted and emotionally disturbed sixteen-year-old he had met\\nthrough a mutual friend in a gifted children's program. A year later\\nthey had a child.\\n\\nMendax made many of his friends through the computer community. He\\nfound Trax easy to talk to and they often spent up to five hours on a\\nsingle phone call. Prime Suspect, on the other hand, was hard work on\\nthe phone.\\n\\nQuiet and introverted, Prime Suspect always seemed to run out of\\nconversation after five minutes. Mendax was himself naturally shy, so\\ntheir talks were often filled with long silences. It wasn't that\\nMendax didn't like Prime Suspect, he did. By the time the three\\nhackers met in person at Trax's home in mid-1991, he considered Prime\\nSuspect more than just a fellow hacker in the tight-knit IS circle.\\nMendax considered him a friend.\\n\\nPrime Suspect was a boy of veneers. To most of the world, he appeared\\nto be a studious year 12 student bound for university from his upper\\nmiddle-class grammar school. The all-boys school never expected less\\nfrom its students and the possibility of attending a TAFE--a\\nvocational college--was never discussed as an option. University was\\nthe object. Any student who failed to make it was quietly swept under\\nthe carpet like some sort of distasteful food dropping.\\n\\nPrime Suspect's own family situation did not mirror the veneer of\\nrespectability portrayed by his school. His father, a pharmacist, and\\nhis mother, a nurse, had been in the midst of an acrimonious divorce\\nbattle when his father was diagnosed with terminal cancer. In this\\nbitter, antagonistic environment, the eight-year-old Prime Suspect was\\ndelivered to his father's bedside in hospice for a rushed few moments\\nto bid him farewell.\\n\\nThrough much of his childhood and adolescence, Prime Suspect's mother\\nremained bitter and angry about life, and particularly her\\nimpoverished financial situation. When he was eight, Prime Suspect's\\nolder sister left home at sixteen, moved to Perth and refused to speak\\nto her mother. In some ways, Prime Suspect felt he was expected be\\nboth child and de facto parent. All of which made him grow up faster\\nin some ways, but remain immature in others.\\n\\nPrime Suspect responded to the anger around him by retreating into his\\nroom. When he bought his first computer, an Apple IIe, at age thirteen\\nhe found it better company than any of his relatives. The computers at\\nschool didn't hold much interest for him, since they weren't connected\\nto the outside world via modem. After reading about BBSes in the Apple\\nUsers' Society newsletter, he saved up for his own modem and soon\\nbegan connecting into various BBSes.\\n\\nSchool did, however, provide the opportunity to rebel, albeit\\nanonymously, and he conducted extensive pranking campaigns. Few\\nteachers suspected the quiet, clean-cut boy and he was rarely caught.\\nNature had endowed Prime Suspect with the face of utter innocence.\\nTall and slender with brown curly hair, his true character only showed\\nin the elfish grin which sometimes passed briefly across his baby\\nface. Teachers told his mother he was underachieving compared to his\\nlevel of intelligence, but had few complaints otherwise.\\n\\nBy year 10, he had become a serious hacker and was spending every\\navailable moment at his computer. Sometimes he skipped school, and he\\noften handed assignments in late. He found it difficult to come up\\nwith ever more creative excuses and sometimes he imagined telling his\\nteachers the truth. `Sorry I didn't get that 2000-word paper done but\\nI was knee-deep in NASA networks last night.' The thought made him\\nlaugh.\\n\\nHe saw girls as a unwanted distraction from hacking. Sometimes, after\\nhe chatted with a girl at a party, his friends would later ask him why\\nhe hadn't asked her out. Prime Suspect shrugged it off. The real\\nreason was that he would rather get home to his computer, but he never\\ndiscussed his hacking with anyone at school, not even with Mentat.\\n\\nA friend of Force's and occasional visitor to The Realm, Mentat was\\ntwo years ahead of Prime Suspect at school and in general couldn't be\\nbothered talking to so junior a hacker as Prime Suspect. The younger\\nhacker didn't mind. He had witnessed other hackers' indiscretions,\\nwanted no part of them and was happy to keep his hacking life private.\\n\\nBefore the Realm bust, Phoenix rang him up once at 2 a.m. suggesting\\nthat he and Nom come over there and then. Woken by the call, Prime\\nSuspect's mother stood in the doorway to his bedroom, remonstrating\\nwith him for letting his `friends' call at such a late hour. With\\nPhoenix goading him in one ear, and his mother chewing him out in the\\nother, Prime Suspect decided the whole thing was a bad idea. He said\\nno thanks to Phoenix, and shut the door on his mother.\\n\\nHe did, however, talk to Powerspike on the phone once in a while. The\\nolder hacker's highly irreverent attitude and Porky Pig laugh appealed\\nto him. But other than those brief talks, Prime Suspect avoided\\ntalking on the phone to people outside the International Subversives,\\nespecially when he and Mendax moved into ever more sensitive military\\ncomputers.\\n\\nUsing a program called Sycophant written by Mendax, the IS hackers had\\nbeen conducting massive attacks on the US military. They divided up\\nSycophant on eight attack machines, often choosing university systems\\nat places like the Australian National University or the University of\\nTexas. They pointed the eight machines at the targets and fired.\\nWithin six hours, the eight machines had assaulted thousands of\\ncomputers. The hackers sometimes reaped 100000 accounts each night.\\n\\nUsing Sycophant, they essentially forced a cluster of Unix machines in\\na computer network to attack the entire Internet en masse.\\n\\nAnd that was just the start of what they were into. They had been in\\nso many sites they often couldn't remember if they\\nhad actually hacked a particular computer. The places they could\\nrecall read like a Who's Who of the American military-industrial\\ncomplex. The US Airforce 7th Command Group Headquarters in the\\nPentagon. Stanford Research Institute in California. Naval Surface\\nWarfare Center in Virginia. Lockheed Martin's Tactical Aircraft\\nSystems Air Force Plant in Texas. Unisys Corporation in Blue Bell,\\nPennsylvania. Goddard Space Flight Center, NASA. Motorola Inc. in\\nIllinois. TRW Inc. in Redondo Beach, California. Alcoa in Pittsburgh.\\nPanasonic Corp in New Jersey. US Naval Undersea Warfare Engineering\\nStation. Siemens-Nixdorf Information Systems in Massachusetts.\\nSecurities Industry Automation Corp in New York. Lawrence Livermore\\nNational Laboratory in California. Bell Communications Research, New\\nJersey. Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, California.\\n\\nAs the IS hackers reached a level of sophistication beyond anything\\nThe Realm had achieved, they realised that progress carried\\nconsiderable risk and began to withdraw completely from the broader\\nAustralian hacking community. Soon they had drawn a tight circle\\naround themselves. They talked only to each other.\\n\\nWatching the Realm hackers go down hadn't deterred the next generation\\nof hackers. It had only driven them further underground.\\n\\nIn the spring of 1991, Prime Suspect and Mendax began a race to get\\nroot on the US Department of Defense's Network Information Center\\n(NIC) computer--potentially the most important computer on the\\nInternet.\\n\\nAs both hackers chatted amiably on-line one night, on a Melbourne\\nUniversity computer, Prime Suspect worked quietly in another screen to\\npenetrate ns.nic.ddn.mil, a US Department of Defense system closely\\nlinked to NIC. He believed the sister system and NIC might `trust'\\neach other--a trust he could exploit to get into NIC. And NIC did\\neverything.\\n\\nNIC assigned domain names--the `.com' or `.net' at the end of an email\\naddress--for the entire Internet. NIC also controlled the US\\nmilitary's own internal defence data network, known as MILNET.\\n\\nNIC also published the communication protocol standards for all of the\\nInternet. Called RFCs (Request for Comments), these technical\\nspecifications allowed one computer on the Internet to talk to\\nanother. The Defense Data Network Security Bulletins, the US\\nDepartment of Defense's equivalent of CERT advisories, came from the\\nNIC machine.\\n\\nPerhaps most importantly, NIC controlled the reverse look-up service\\non the Internet. Whenever someone connects to another site across the\\nInternet, he or she typically types in the site name--say,\\nariel.unimelb.edu.au at the University of Melbourne. The computer then\\ntranslates the alphabetical name into a numerical address--the IP\\naddress--in this case 128.250.20.3. All the computers on the Internet\\nneed this IP address to relay the packets of data onto the final\\ndestination computer. NIC decided how Internet computers would\\ntranslate the alphabetical name into an IP address, and vice versa.\\n\\nIf you controlled NIC, you had phenomenal power on the Internet. You\\ncould, for example, simply make Australia disappear. Or you could turn\\nit into Brazil. By pointing all Internet addresses ending in\\n`.au'--the designation for sites in Australia--to Brazil, you could\\ncut Australia's part of the Internet off from the rest of the world\\nand send all Australian Internet traffic to Brazil. In fact, by\\nchanging the delegation of all the domain names, you could virtually\\nstop the flow of information between all the countries on the\\nInternet.\\n\\nThe only way someone could circumvent this power was by typing in the\\nfull numerical IP address instead of a proper alphabetical address.\\nBut few people knew the up-to-twelve-digit IP equivalent of their\\nalphabetical addresses, and fewer still actually used them.\\n\\nControlling NIC offered other benefits as well. Control NIC, and you\\nowned a virtual pass-key into any computer on the Internet which\\n`trusted' another. And most machines trust at least one other system.\\n\\nWhenever one computer connects to another across the Net, both\\nmachines go through a special meet-and-greet process. The receiving\\ncomputer looks over the first machine and asks itself\\na few questions. What's the name of the incoming machine?\\nIs that name allowed to connect to me? In what ways am I\\nprogrammed to `trust' that machine--to wave my normal security for\\nconnections from that system?\\n\\nThe receiving computer answers these questions based in large part on\\ninformation provided by NIC. All of which means that, by controlling\\nNIC, you could make any computer on the Net `pose' as a machine\\ntrusted by a computer you might want to hack. Security often depended\\non a computer's name, and NIC effectively controlled that name.\\n\\nWhen Prime Suspect managed to get inside NIC's sister system, he told\\nMendax and gave him access to the computer. Each hacker then began his\\nown attack on NIC. When Mendax finally got root on NIC, the power was\\nintoxicating. Prime Suspect got root at the same time but using a\\ndifferent method. They were both in.\\n\\nInside NIC, Mendax began by inserting a backdoor--a method of getting\\nback into the computer at a later date in case an admin repaired the\\nsecurity flaws the hackers had used to get into the machine. From now\\non, if he telnetted into the system's Data Defense Network (DDN)\\ninformation server and typed `login 0' he would have instant,\\ninvisible root access to NIC.\\n\\nThat step completed, he looked around for interesting things to read.\\nOne file held what appeared to be a list of satellite and microwave\\ndish coordinates--longitude, latitudes, transponder frequencies. Such\\ncoordinates might in theory allow someone to build a complete map of\\ncommunications devices which were used to move the DOD's computer data\\naround the world.\\n\\nMendax also penetrated MILNET's Security Coordination Center, which\\ncollected reports on every possible security incident on a MILNET\\ncomputer. Those computers--largely TOPS-20s made by DEC--contained\\ngood automatic security programs. Any number of out-of-the-ordinary\\nevents would trigger an automatic security report. Someone logging\\ninto a machine for too long. A large number of failed login attempts,\\nsuggesting password guessing. Two people logging into the same account\\nat the same time. Alarm bells would go off and the local computer\\nwould immediately send a security violation report to the MILNET\\nsecurity centre, where it would be added to the `hot list'.\\n\\nMendax flipped through page after page of MILNET's security reports on\\nhis screen. Most looked like nothing--MILNET users accidentally\\nstumbling over a security tripwire--but one notice from a US military\\nsite in Germany stood out. It was not computer generated. This was\\nfrom a real human being. The system admin reported that someone had\\nbeen repeatedly trying to break into his or her machine, and had\\neventually managed to get in. The admin was trying, without much luck,\\nto trace back the intruder's connection to its point of origin. Oddly,\\nit appeared to originate in another MILNET system.\\n\\nRiffling through other files, Mendax found mail confirming that the\\nattack had indeed come from inside MILNET. His eyes grew wide as he\\nread on. US military hackers had broken into MILNET systems, using\\nthem for target practice, and no-one had bothered to tell the system\\nadmin at the target site.\\n\\nMendax couldn't believe it. The US military was hacking its own\\ncomputers. This discovery led to another, more disturbing, thought. If\\nthe US military was hacking its own computers for practice, what was\\nit doing to other countries' computers?\\n\\nAs he quietly backed out of the system, wiping away his footprints as\\nhe tip-toed away, Mendax thought about what he had seen. He was deeply\\ndisturbed that any hacker would work for the US military.\\n\\nHackers, he thought, should be anarchists, not hawks.\\n\\nIn early October 1991, Mendax rang Trax and gave him the dial-up and\\naccount details for NMELH1.\\n\\nTrax wasn't much of a hacker, but Mendax admired his phreaking\\ntalents. Trax was the father of phreaking in Australia and Trax's\\nToolbox, his guide to the art of phreaking, was\\nlegendary. Mendax thought Trax might find some interesting detailed\\ninformation inside the NorTel network on how to\\ncontrol telephone switches.\\n\\nTrax invented multi-frequency code phreaking. By sending special\\ntones--generated by his computer program--down the phone line, he\\ncould control certain functions in the telephone exchange. Many\\nhackers had learned how to make free phone calls by charging the cost\\nto someone else or to calling cards, but Trax discovered how to make\\nphone calls which weren't charged to anyone. The calls weren't just\\nfree; they were untraceable.\\n\\nTrax wrote 48 pages on his discovery and called it The Australian\\nPhreakers Manual Volumes 1-7. But as he added more and more to the\\nmanual, he became worried what would happen if he released it in the\\nunderground, so he decided he would only show it to the other two\\nInternational Subversive hackers.\\n\\nHe went on to publish The Advanced Phreaker's Manual,2 a second\\nedition of the manual, in The International Subversive, the\\nunderground magazine edited by Mendax:\\n\\nAn electronic magazine, The International Subversive had a simple\\neditorial policy. You could only have a copy of the magazine if you\\nwrote an `article'. The policy was a good way of protecting against\\nnappies--sloppy or inexperienced hackers who might accidentally draw\\npolice attention. Nappies also tended to abuse good phreaking and\\nhacking techniques, which might cause Telecom to close up security\\nholes. The result was that IS had a circulation of just three people.\\n\\nTo a non-hacker, IS looked like gobbledygook--the phone book made more\\ninteresting reading. But to a member of the computer underground, IS\\nwas a treasure map. A good hacker could follow the trail of modem\\nphone numbers and passwords, then use the directions in IS to\\ndisappear through secret entrances into the labyrinth of forbidden\\ncomputer networks. Armed with the magazine, he could slither out of\\ntight spots, outwit system admins and find the treasure secreted in\\neach computer system.\\n\\nFor Prime Suspect and Mendax, who were increasingly paranoid about\\nline traces from the university modems they used as launchpads, Trax's\\nphreaking skills were a gift from heaven.\\n\\nTrax made his great discovery by accident. He was using a phone\\nsprinter, a simple computer program which automatically dialled a\\nrange of phone numbers looking for modems. If he turned the volume up\\non his modem when his computer dialled what seemed to be a dead or\\nnon-existent number, he sometimes heard a soft clicking noise after\\nthe disconnection message. The noise sounded like faint heartbeats.\\n\\nCurious, he experimented with these strange numbers and soon\\ndiscovered they were disconnected lines which had not yet been\\nreassigned. He wondered how he could use these odd numbers. After\\nreading a document Mendax had found in Britain and uploaded to The\\nDevil's Playground, another BBS, Trax had an idea. The posting\\nprovided information about CCITT #5 signalling tones, CCITT being the\\ninternational standard--the language spoken by telephone exchanges\\nbetween countries.\\n\\nWhen you make an international phone call from Australia to the US,\\nthe call passes from the local telephone exchange to an international\\ngateway exchange within Australia. From there, it travels to an\\nexchange in the US. The CCITT signalling tones were the special tones\\nthe two international gateway exchanges used to communicate with each\\nother.\\n\\nTelecom Australia adapted a later version of this standard, called R2,\\nfor use on its own domestic exchanges. Telecom called this new\\nstandard MFC, or multi-frequency code. When, say, Trax rang Mendax,\\nhis exchange asked Mendax's to `talk' to Mendax's phone by using these\\ntones. Mendax's exchange `answered', perhaps saying Mendax's phone was\\nbusy or disconnected. The Telecom-adapted tones--pairs of audio\\nfrequencies--did not exist in normal telephone keypads and you\\ncouldn't make them simply by punching keys on your household\\ntelephone.\\n\\nTrax wrote a program which allowed his Amstrad computer to generate the\\nspecial tones and send them down the phone line. In an act many in the\\nunderground later considered to be a stroke of genius, he began to map\\nout exactly what each tone did. It was a difficult task, since one tone\\ncould mean several different things at each stage of the `conversation'\\nbetween two exchanges.\\n\\nPassionate about his new calling, Trax went trashing in Telecom\\ngarbage bins, where he found an MFC register list--an invaluable piece\\nof his puzzle. Using the list, along with pieces of overseas phreaking\\nfiles and a great deal of painstaking hands-on effort, Trax slowly\\nlearned the language of the Australian telephone exchanges. Then he\\ntaught the language to his computer.\\n\\nTrax tried calling one of the `heartbeat' phone numbers again. He\\nbegan playing his special, computer-generated tones through an\\namplifier. In simple terms, he was able to fool other exchanges into\\nthinking he was his local Telecom exchange. More accurately, Trax had\\nmade his exchange drop him into the outgoing signalling trunk that had\\nbeen used to route to the disconnected phone number.\\n\\nTrax could now call out--anywhere--as if he was calling from a point\\nhalfway between his own phone and the disconnected number. If he\\ncalled a modem at Melbourne University, for instance, and the line was\\nbeing traced, his home phone number would not show up on the trace\\nrecords. No-one would be charged for the call because Trax's calls\\nwere ghosts in the phone system.\\n\\nTrax continued to refine his ability to manipulate both the telephone\\nand the exchange. He took his own telephone apart, piece by piece,\\ncountless times, fiddling with the parts until he understood exactly\\nhow it worked. Within months, he was able to do far more than just\\nmake free phone calls. He could, for instance, make a line trace think\\nthat he had come from a specific telephone number.\\n\\nHe and Mendax joked that if they called a `hot' site they would use\\nTrax's technique to send the line trace--and the bill--back to one\\nvery special number. The one belonging to the AFP's Computer Crime\\nUnit in Melbourne.\\n\\nAll three IS hackers suspected the AFP was close on their heels.\\nRoving through the Canberra-based computer system belonging to the man\\nwho essentially ran the Internet in Australia, Geoff Huston, they\\nwatched the combined efforts of police and the Australian Academic and\\nResearch Network (AARNET) to trace them.\\n\\nCraig Warren of Deakin University had written to Huston, AARNET\\ntechnical manager, about hacker attacks on university systems. Huston\\nhad forwarded a copy of the letter to Peter Elford, who assisted\\nHuston in managing AARNET. The hackers broke into Huston's system and\\nalso read the letter:\\n\\nFrom G.Huston@aarnet.edu.au Mon Sep 23 09:40:43 1991\\n\\nReceived: from [150.203.6.67] by jatz.aarnet.edu.au with SMTP id\\nAA00265 (5.65+/IDA-1.3.5 for pte900); Mon, 23 Sep 91 09:40:39 +1000\\n\\nDate: Mon, 23 Sep 91 09:40:39 +1000\\n\\nMessage-Id: <9109222340.AA00265@jatz.aarnet.edu.au>\\n\\nTo: pte900@aarnet.edu.au\\n\\nFrom: G.Huston@aarnet.edu.au\\n\\nSubject: Re: Visitors log Thursday Night--Friday Morning\\n\\nStatus: RO\\n\\nDate: Sun, 22 Sep 91 19:29:13 +1000\\n\\nFrom: Craig Warren <C.Warren@deakin.OZ.AU>\\n\\n\\n\\nJust to give you a little bit of an idea about what has been\\nhappening since we last spoke...\\n\\n\\n\\nWe have communicated with Sgt Ken Day of the Federal Police about 100\\ntimes in the last week. Together with our counterparts from\\nWarrnambool traces have been arranged on dial-in lines and on Austpac\\nlines for the capella.cc.deakin.OZ.AU terminal server which was left\\nopen to the world.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn Friday afternoon we were able to trace a call back to a person in\\nthe Warrnambool telephone district. The police have this persons name.\\nWe believe others are involved, as we have seen up to 3 people active\\nat any one time. It is `suspected' students from RMIT and perhaps\\nstudents from Deakin are also involved.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I left on Friday night, there was plenty of activity still and\\nthe police and Telecom were tracking down another number.\\n\\n\\n\\nTomorrow morning I will talk to all parties involved, but it is\\nlikely we will have the names of at least 2 or 3 people that are\\ninvolved. We will probably shut down access of `cappella' to AARNet at\\nthis stage, and let the police go about their business of prosecuting\\nthese people.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou will be `pleased' (:-)) to know you have not been the only ones\\nunder attack. I know of at least 2 other sites in Victoria that have\\nhad people attacking them. One of them was Telecom which helped get\\nTelecom involved!\\n\\n\\n\\nI will brief you all in the next day or so as to what has happened.\\n\\n\\n\\nRegards, Craig\\n\\n\\n\\nThe `other' people were, of course, the IS hackers. There is nothing\\nlike reading about your own hacking antics in some one's security\\nmail.\\n\\nMendax and Prime Suspect frequently visited ANU's computers to read\\nthe security mail there. However, universities were usually nothing\\nspecial, just jumping-off points and, occasionally, good sources of\\ninformation on how close the AFP were to closing in on the IS hackers.\\n\\nFar more interesting to Mendax were his initial forays into Telecom's\\nexchanges. Using a modem number Prime Suspect had found, he dialled\\ninto what he suspected was Telecom's Lonsdale Exchange in downtown\\nMelbourne. When his modem connected to another one, all he saw was a\\nblank screen. He tried a few basic commands which might give him help\\nto understand the system:\\n\\nLogin. List. Attach.\\n\\nThe exchange's computer remained silent.\\n\\nMendax ran a program he had written to fire off every recognised\\nkeyboard character--256 of them--at another machine. Nothing again. He\\nthen tried the break signal--the Amiga key and the character B pressed\\nsimultaneously. That got an answer of sorts.\\n\\n:\\n\\nHe pulled up another of his hacking tools, a program which dumped 200\\ncommon commands to the other machine. Nothing. Finally, he tried\\ntyping `logout'. That gave him an answer:\\n\\nerror, not logged on\\n\\nAh, thought Mendax. The command is `logon' not `login'.\\n\\n:logon\\n\\nThe Telecom exchange answered: `username:' Now all Mendax had to do\\nwas figure out a username and password.\\n\\nHe knew that Telecom used NorTel equipment. More than likely, NorTel\\nstaff were training Telecom workers and would need access themselves.\\nIf there were lots of NorTel employees working on many different phone\\nswitches, it would be difficult to pass on secure passwords to staff\\nall the time. NorTel and Telecom people would probably pick something\\neasy and universal. What password best fitted that description?\\n\\nusername: nortel\\n\\npassword: nortel\\n\\nIt worked.\\n\\nUnfortunately, Mendax didn't know which commands to use once he got\\ninto the machine, and there was no on-line documentation to provide\\nhelp. The telephone switch had its own language, unlike anything he\\nhad ever encountered before.\\n\\nAfter hours of painstaking research, Mendax constructed a list of\\ncommands which would work on the exchange's computer. The exchange\\nappeared to control all the special six-digit phone numbers beginning\\nwith 13, such as those used for airline reservations or some pizza\\ndelivery services. It was Telecom's `Intelligent Network' which did\\nmany specific tasks, including routing calls to the nearest possible\\nbranch of the organisation being called. Mendax looked through the\\nlist of commands, found `RANGE', and recognised it as a command which\\nwould allow someone to select all the phone numbers in a certain\\nrange. He selected a thousand numbers, all with the prefix 634, which\\nhe believed to be in Telecom's Queen Street offices.\\n\\nNow, to test a command. Mendax wanted something innocuous, which\\nwouldn't screw up the 1000 lines permanently. It was almost 7 a.m. and\\nhe needed to wrap things up before Telecom employees began coming into\\nwork.\\n\\n`RING' seemed harmless enough. It might ring one of the numbers in the\\nrange after another--a process he could stop. He typed the command in.\\nNothing happened. Then a few full stops began to slowly spread across\\nhis screen:\\n\\n. . . . . . .\\n\\nRUNG\\n\\nThe system had just rung all 1000 numbers at the same time. One\\nthousand phones ringing all at once.\\n\\nWhat if some buttoned-down Telecom engineer had driven to work early\\nthat morning to get some work done? What if he had just settled down\\nat his standard-issue metal Telecom desk with a cup of bad instant\\ncoffee in a styrofoam cup when suddenly ... every telephone in the\\nskyscraper had rung out simultaneously? How suspicious would that\\nlook? Mendax thought it was time to high-tail it out of there.\\n\\nOn his way out, he disabled the logs for the modem line he came in on.\\nThat way, no-one would be able to see what he had been up to. In fact,\\nhe hoped no-one would know that anyone had even used the dial-up line\\nat all.\\n\\nPrime Suspect didn't think there was anything wrong with exploring the\\nNorTel computer system. Many computer sites posted warnings in the\\nlogin screen about it being illegal to break into the system, but the\\neighteen-year-old didn't consider himself an intruder. In Prime\\nSuspect's eyes, `intruder' suggested someone with ill intent--perhaps\\nsomeone planning to do damage to the system--and he certainly had no\\nill intent. He was just a visitor.\\n\\nMendax logged into the NMELH1 system by using the account Prime\\nSuspect had given him, and immediately looked around to see who else\\nwas on-line. Prime Suspect and about nine other people, only three of\\nwhom were actually doing something at their terminal.\\n\\nPrime Suspect and Mendax raced to get root on the system. The IS\\nhackers may not have been the type to brag about their conquests in\\nthe underground, but each still had a competitive streak when it came\\nto see who could get control over the system first. There was no ill\\nwill, just a little friendly competition between mates.\\n\\nMendax poked around and realised the root directory, which contained\\nthe password file, was effectively world writable. This was good news,\\nand with some quick manipulation he would be able to insert something\\ninto the root directory. On a more secure system, unprivileged users\\nwould not be able to do that. Mendax could also copy things from the\\ndirectory on this site, and change the names of subdirectories within\\nthe main root directory. All these permissions were important, for\\nthey would enable him to create a Trojan.\\n\\nNamed for the Trojan horse which precipitated the fall of Troy, the\\nTrojan is a favoured approach with most computer hackers. The hacker\\nsimply tricks a computer system or a user into thinking that a\\nslightly altered file or directory--the Trojan--is the legitimate one.\\nThe Trojan directory, however, contains false information to fool the\\ncomputer into doing something the hacker wants. Alternatively, the\\nTrojan might simply trick a legitimate user into giving away valuable\\ninformation, such as his user name and password.\\n\\nMendax made a new directory and copied the contents of the legitimate\\nETC directory--where the password files were stored--into it. The\\npasswords were encrypted, so there wasn't much sense trying to look at\\none since the hacker wouldn't be able to read it. Instead, he selected\\na random legitimate user--call him Joe--and deleted his password. With\\nno password, Mendax would be able to login as Joe without any\\nproblems.\\n\\nHowever, Joe was just an average user. He didn't have root, which is\\nwhat Mendax wanted. But like every other user on the system, Joe had a\\nuser identity number. Mendax changed Joe's user id to `0'--the magic\\nnumber. A user with `0' as his id had root. Joe had just acquired\\npower usually only given to system administrators. Of course, Mendax\\ncould have searched out a user on the list who already had root, but\\nthere were system operators logged onto the system and it might have\\nraised suspicions if another operator with root access had logged in\\nover the dial-up lines. The best line of defence was to avoid making\\nanyone on the system suspicious in the first place.\\n\\nThe problem now was to replace the original ETC directory with the\\nTrojan one. Mendax did not have the privileges to delete the\\nlegitimate ETC directory, but he could change the name of a directory.\\nSo he changed the name of the ETC directory to something the computer\\nsystem would not recognise. Without access to its list of users, the\\ncomputer could not perform most of its functions. People would not be\\nable to log in, see who else was on the system or send electronic\\nmail. Mendax had to work very quickly. Within a matter of minutes,\\nsomeone would notice the system had serious problems.\\n\\nMendax renamed his Trojan directory ETC. The system instantly read the\\nfake directory, including Joe's now non-existent password, and\\nelevated status as a super-user. Mendax logged in again, this time as\\nJoe.\\n\\nIn less than five minutes, a twenty-year-old boy with little formal\\neducation, a pokey $700 computer and painfully slow modem had\\nconquered the Melbourne computer system of one of the world's largest\\ntelecommunications companies.\\n\\nThere were still a few footprints to be cleaned up. The next time Joe\\nlogged in, he would wonder why the computer didn't ask for his\\npassword. And he might be surprised to discover he had been\\ntransformed into a super-user. So Mendax used his super-user status to\\ndelete the Trojan ETC file and return the original one to its proper\\nplace. He also erased records showing he had ever logged in as Joe.\\n\\nTo make sure he could login with super-user privileges in future,\\nMendax installed a special program which would automatically grant him\\nroot access. He hid the program in the bowels of the system and, just\\nto be safe, created a special feature so that it could only be\\nactivated with a secret keystroke.\\n\\nMendax wrestled a root account from NMELH1 first, but Prime Suspect\\nwasn't far behind. Trax joined them a little later. When they began\\nlooking around, they could not believe what they had found. The system\\nhad one of the weirdest structures they had ever come across.\\n\\nMost large networks have a hierarchical structure. Further, most hold\\nthe addresses of a handful of other systems in the network, usually\\nthe systems which are closest in the flow of the external network.\\n\\nBut the NorTel network was not structured that way. What the IS\\nhackers found was a network with no hierarchy. It was a totally flat\\nname space. And the network was weird in other ways too. Every\\ncomputer system on it contained the address of every other computer,\\nand there were more than 11000 computers in NorTel's worldwide\\nnetwork. What the hackers were staring at was like a giant internal\\ncorporate Internet which had been squashed flat as a pancake.\\n\\nMendax had seen many flat structures before, but never on this scale.\\nIt was bizarre. In hierarchical structures, it is easier to tell where\\nthe most important computer systems--and information--are kept. But\\nthis structure, where every system was virtually equal, was going to\\nmake it considerably more difficult for the hackers to navigate their\\nway through the network. Who could tell whether a system housed the\\nChristmas party invite list or the secret designs for a new NorTel\\nproduct?\\n\\nThe NorTel network was firewalled, which meant that there was\\nvirtually no access from the outside world. Mendax reckoned that this\\nmade it more vulnerable to hackers who managed to get in through\\ndial-ups. It appeared that security on the NorTel network was\\nrelatively relaxed since it was virtually impossible to break in\\nthrough the Internet. By sneaking in the backdoor, the hackers found\\nthemselves able to raid all sorts of NorTel sites, from St Kilda Road\\nin Melbourne to the corporation's headquarters in Toronto.\\n\\nIt was fantastic, this huge, trusting network of computer sites at\\ntheir fingertips, and the young hackers were elated with the\\nanticipation of exploration. One of them described it as being `like a\\nshipwrecked man washed ashore on a Tahitian island populated by 11000\\nvirgins, just ripe for the picking'.\\n\\nThey found a YP, or yellow pages, database linked to 400 of the\\ncomputer sites. These 400 sites were dependent on this YP database for\\ntheir password files. Mendax managed to get root on the YP database,\\nwhich gave him instant control over 400 computer systems. Groovy.\\n\\nOne system was home to a senior NorTel computer security administrator\\nand Mendax promptly headed off to check out his mailbox. The contents\\nmade him laugh.\\n\\nA letter from the Australian office said that Australia's Telecom\\nwanted access to CORWAN, NorTel's corporate wide area network. Access\\nwould involve linking CORWAN and a small Telecom network. This seemed\\nreasonable enough since Telecom did business with NorTel and staff\\nwere communicating all the time.\\n\\nThe Canadian security admin had written back turning down the request\\nbecause there were too many hackers in the Telecom network.\\n\\nToo many hackers in Telecom? Now that was funny. Here was a hacker\\nreading the sensitive mail of NorTel's computer security expert who\\nreckoned Telecom's network was too exposed. In fact, Mendax had\\npenetrated Telecom's systems from NorTel's CORWAN, not the other way\\nround.\\n\\nPerhaps to prove the point, Mendax decided to crack passwords to the\\nNorTel system. He collected 1003 password files from the NorTel sites,\\npulled up his password cracking program, THC, and started hunting\\naround the network for some spare computers to do the job for him. He\\nlocated a collection of 40 Sun computers, probably housed in Canada,\\nand set up his program on them.\\n\\nTHC ran very fast on those Sun4s. The program used a 60000 word\\ndictionary borrowed from someone in the US army who had done a thesis\\non cryptography and password cracking. It also relied on `a\\nparticularly nice fast-crypt algorithm' being developed by a\\nQueensland academic, Eric Young. The THC program worked about 30 times\\nfaster than it would have done using the standard algorithm.\\n\\nUsing all 40 computers, Mendax was throwing as many as 40000 guesses\\nper second against the password lists. A couple of the Suns went down\\nunder the strain, but most held their place in the onslaught. The\\nsecret passwords began dropping like flies. In just a few hours,\\nMendax had cracked 5000 passwords, some 100 of which were to root\\naccounts. He now had access to thousands of NorTel computers across\\nthe globe.\\n\\nThere were some very nice prizes to be had from these systems. Gain\\ncontrol over a large company's computer systems and you virtually\\ncontrolled the company itself. It was as though you could walk through\\nevery security barrier unchecked, beginning with the front door. Want\\neach employee's security codes for the office's front door? There it\\nwas--on-line.\\n\\nHow about access to the company's payroll records? You could see how\\nmuch money each person earns. Better still, you might like to make\\nyourself an employee and pay yourself a tidy once-off bonus through\\nelectronic funds transfer. Of course there were other, less obvious,\\nways of making money, such as espionage.\\n\\nMendax could have easily found highly sensitive information about\\nplanned NorTel products and sold them. For a company like NorTel,\\nwhich spent more than $1 billion each year on research and\\ndevelopment, information leaks about its new technologies could be\\ndevastating. The espionage wouldn't even have to be about new\\nproducts; it could simply be about the company's business strategies.\\nWith access to all sorts of internal memos between senior executives,\\na hacker could procure precious inside information on markets and\\nprices. A competitor might pay handsomely for this sort of\\ninformation.\\n\\nAnd this was just the start of what a malicious or profit-motivated\\nhacker could do. In many companies, the automated aspects of\\nmanufacturing plants are controlled by computers. The smallest changes\\nto the programs controlling the machine tools could destroy an entire\\nbatch of widgets--and the multi-million dollar robotics machinery\\nwhich manufactures them.\\n\\nBut the IS hackers had no intention of committing information\\nespionage. In fact, despite their poor financial status as students\\nor, in the case of Trax, as a young man starting his career at the\\nbottom of the totem pole, none of them would have sold information\\nthey gained from hacking. In their view, such behaviour was dirty and\\ndeserving of contempt--it soiled the adventure and was against their\\nethics. They considered themselves explorers, not paid corporate\\nspies.\\n\\nAlthough the NorTel network was firewalled, there was one link to the\\nInternet. The link was through a system called\\nBNRGATE, Bell-Northern Research's gateway to the Internet.\\nBell-Northern is NorTel's R&D subsidiary. The connection to the\\noutside electronic world was very restricted, but it looked\\ninteresting. The only problem was how to get there.\\n\\nMendax began hunting around for a doorway. His password cracking\\nprogram had not turned up anything for this system, but there were\\nother, more subtle ways of getting a password than the brute force of\\na cracking program.\\n\\nSystem administrators sometimes sent passwords through email. Normally\\nthis would be a major security risk, but the NorTel system was\\nfirewalled from the Internet, so the admins thought they had no real\\nreason to be concerned about hackers. Besides, in such a large\\ncorporation spanning several continents, an admin couldn't always just\\npop downstairs to give a new company manager his password in person.\\nAnd an impatient manager was unlikely to be willing to wait a week for\\nthe new password to arrive courtesy of snail mail.\\n\\nIn the NorTel network, a mail spool, where email was stored, was often\\nshared between as many as twenty computer systems. This structure\\noffered considerable advantages for Mendax. All he needed to do was\\nbreak into the mail spool and run a keyword search through its\\ncontents. Tell the computer to search for word combinations such as\\n`BNRGATE' and `password', or to look for the name of the system admin\\nfor BNRGATE, and likely as not it would deliver tender morsels of\\ninformation such as new passwords.\\n\\nMendax used a password he found through this method to get into\\nBNRGATE and look around. The account he was using only had very\\nrestricted privileges, and he couldn't get root on the system. For\\nexample, he could not FTP files from outside the NorTel network in the\\nnormal way. Among Internet users FTP (file transfer protocol) is both\\na noun and a verb: to FTP a program is to slurp a copy of it off one\\ncomputer site into your own. There is nothing illegal about FTP-ing\\nsomething per se, and millions of people across the Internet do so\\nquite legitimately.\\n\\nIt appeared to Mendax that the NorTel network admins allowed most\\nusers to FTP something from the Internet, but prevented them from\\ntaking the copied file back to their NorTel computer site. It was\\nstored in a special holding pen in\\nBNRGATE and, like quarantine officers, the system admins would\\npresumably come along regularly and inspect the contents to make sure\\nthere were no hidden viruses or Trojans which hackers might use to\\nsneak into the network from the Internet.\\n\\nHowever, a small number of accounts on BNRGATE had fewer restrictions.\\nMendax broke into one of these accounts and went out to the Internet.\\n\\nPeople from the Internet were barred from entering the NorTel network\\nthrough BNRGATE. However, people inside NorTel could go out to the\\nInternet via telnet.\\n\\nHackers had undoubtedly tried to break into NorTel through BNRGATE.\\nDozens, perhaps hundreds, had unsuccessfully flung themselves against\\nBNRGATE's huge fortifications. To a hacker, the NorTel network was\\nlike a medieval castle and the\\nBNRGATE firewall was an impossible battlement. It was a particular\\ndelight for Mendax to telnet out from behind this firewall into the\\nInternet. It was as if he was walking out from the castle, past the\\nguards and well-defended turrets, over the drawbridge and the moat,\\ninto the town below.\\n\\nThe castle also offered the perfect protection for further hacking\\nactivities. Who could chase him? Even if someone managed to follow him\\nthrough the convoluted routing system he might set up to pass through\\na half dozen computer systems, the pursuer would never get past the\\nbattlements. Mendax could just disappear behind the firewall. He could\\nbe any one of 60000 NorTel employees on any one of 11000 computer\\nsystems.\\n\\nMendax telnetted out to the Internet and explored a few sites,\\nincluding the main computer system of Encore, a large computer\\nmanufacturer. He had seen Encore computers before inside at least one\\nuniversity in Melbourne. In his travels, he met up with Corrupt, the\\nAmerican hacker who told Par he had read Theorem's mail.\\n\\nCorrupt was intrigued by Mendax's extensive knowledge of different\\ncomputer systems. When he learned that the Australian hacker was\\ncoming from inside the NorTel firewall, he was impressed.\\n\\nThe hackers began talking regularly, often when Mendax was coming from\\ninside NorTel. The black street fighter from inner-city Brooklyn and\\nthe white intellectual from a leafy outer Melbourne suburb bridged the\\ngap in the anonymity of cyberspace. Sometime during their\\nconversations Corrupt must have decided that Mendax was a worthy\\nhacker, because he gave Mendax a few stolen passwords to Cray\\naccounts.\\n\\nIn the computer underground in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a Cray\\ncomputer account had all the prestige of a platinum charge card. The\\nsort of home computer most hackers could afford at that time had all\\nthe grunt of a golf cart engine, but a Cray was the Rolls-Royce of\\ncomputers. Crays were the biggest, fastest computers in the world.\\nInstitutions such as large universities would shell out millions of\\ndollars on a Cray so the astronomy or physics departments could solve\\nenormous mathematical problems in a fraction of the time it would take\\non a normal computer. A Cray never sat idle overnight or during\\nholiday periods. Cray time was billed out by the minute. Crays were\\nelite.\\n\\nBest of all, Crays were master password crackers. The computer would\\ngo through Mendax's entire password cracking dictionary in just ten\\nseconds. An encrypted password file would simply melt like butter in a\\nfire. To a hacker, it was a beautiful sight, and Corrupt handing a few\\nCray accounts over to Mendax was a friendly show of mutual respect.\\n\\nMendax reciprocated by offering Corrupt a couple of accounts on\\nEncore. The two hackers chatted off and on and even tried to get\\nCorrupt into NorTel. No luck. Not even two of the world's most notable\\nhackers, working in tandem 10 000 miles apart, could get Corrupt\\nthrough the firewall. The two hackers talked now and again, exchanging\\ninformation about what their respective feds were up to and sharing\\nthe occasional account on interesting systems.\\n\\nThe flat structure of the NorTel network created a good challenge\\nsince the only way to find out what was in a particular site, and its\\nimportance, was to invade the site itself. The IS hackers spent hours\\nmost nights roving through the vast system. The next morning one of\\nthem might call another to share tales of the latest exploits or a\\ngood laugh about a particularly funny piece of pilfered email. They\\nwere in high spirits about their adventures.\\n\\nThen, one balmy spring night, things changed.\\n\\nMendax logged into NMELH1 about 2.30 a.m. As usual, he began by\\nchecking the logs which showed what the system operators had been\\ndoing. Mendax did this to make sure the NorTel officials were not onto\\nIS and were not, for example, tracing the telephone call.\\n\\nSomething was wrong. The logs showed that a NorTel system admin had\\nstumbled upon one of their secret directories of files about an hour\\nago. Mendax couldn't figure out how he had found the files, but this\\nwas very serious. If the admin realised there was a hacker in the\\nnetwork he might call the AFP.\\n\\nMendax used the logs of the korn shell, called KSH, to secretly watch\\nwhat the admin was doing. The korn shell records the history of\\ncertain user activities. Whenever the admin typed a command into the\\ncomputer, the KSH stored what had been typed in the history file.\\nMendax accessed that file in such a way that every line typed by the\\nadmin appeared on his computer a split second later.\\n\\nThe admin began inspecting the system, perhaps looking for signs of an\\nintruder. Mendax quietly deleted his incriminating directory. Not\\nfinding any additional clues, the admin decided to inspect the\\nmysterious directory more closely. But the directory had disappeared.\\nThe admin couldn't believe his eyes. Not an hour before there had been\\na suspicious-looking directory in his system and now it had simply\\nvanished. Directories didn't just dissolve into thin air. This was a\\ncomputer--a logical system based on 0s and 1s. It didn't make\\ndecisions to delete directories.\\n\\nA hacker, the admin thought. A hacker must have been in the NorTel\\nsystem and deleted the directory. Was he in the system now? The admin\\nbegan looking at the routes into the system.\\n\\nThe admin was connected to the system from his home, but he wasn't\\nusing the same dial-up lines as the hacker. The admin was connected\\nthrough Austpac, Telecom's commercial X.25 data network. Perhaps the\\nhacker was also coming in through the X.25 connection.\\n\\nMendax watched the admin inspect all the system users coming on over\\nthe X.25 network. No sign of a hacker. Then the admin checked the logs\\nto see who else might have logged on over the past half hour or so.\\nNothing there either.\\n\\nThe admin appeared to go idle for a few minutes. He was probably\\nstaring at his computer terminal in confusion. Good, thought Mendax.\\nStumped. Then the admin twigged. If he couldn't see the hacker's\\npresence on-line, maybe he could see what he was doing on-line. What\\nprograms was the hacker running? The admin headed straight for the\\nprocess list, which showed all the programs being run on the computer\\nsystem.\\n\\nMendax sent the admin a fake error signal. It appears to the admin as\\nif his korn shell had crashed. The admin re-logged in and headed\\nstraight for the process list again.\\n\\nSome people never learn, Mendax thought as he booted the admin off\\nagain with another error message:\\n\\n                 Segmentation violation.\\n\\nThe admin came back again. What persistence. Mendax knocked the admin\\noff once more, this time by freezing up his computer screen.\\n\\nThis game of cat and mouse went on for some time. As long as the admin\\nwas doing what Mendax considered to be normal system administration\\nwork, Mendax left him alone. The minute the admin tried to chase him\\nby inspecting the process list or the dial-up lines, he found himself\\nbooted off his own system.\\n\\nSuddenly, the system administrator seemed to give up. His terminal\\nwent silent.\\n\\nGood, Mendax thought. It's almost 3 a.m. after all. This is my time on\\nthe system. Your time is during the day. You sleep now and I'll play.\\nIn the morning, I'll sleep and you can work.\\n\\nThen, at 3.30 a.m., something utterly unexpected happened. The admin\\nreappeared, except this time he wasn't logged in from home over the\\nX.25 network. He was sitting at the console, the master terminal\\nattached to the computer system at NorTel's Melbourne office. Mendax\\ncouldn't believe it. The admin had got in his car in the middle of the\\nnight and driven into the city just to get to the bottom of the\\nmystery.\\n\\nMendax knew the game was up. Once the system operator was logged in\\nthrough the computer system's console, there was no way to kick him\\noff the system and keep him off. The roles were reversed and the\\nhacker was at the mercy of the admin. At the console, the system admin\\ncould pull the plug to the whole system. Unplug every modem. Close\\ndown every connection to other networks. Turn the computer off. The\\nparty was over.\\n\\nWhen the admin was getting close to tracking down the hacker, a\\nmessage appeared on his screen. This message did not appear with the\\nusual headers attached to messages sent from one system user to\\nanother. It just appeared, as if by magic, in the middle of the\\nadmin's screen:\\n\\n             I have finally become sentient.\\n\\nThe admin stopped dead in his tracks, momentarily giving up his\\nfrantic search for the hacker to contemplate this first contact with\\ncyberspace intelligence. Then another anonymous message, seemingly\\nfrom the depths of the computer system itself, appeared on his screen:\\n\\n                  I have taken control.\\n\\n   For years, I have been struggling in this greyness.\\n\\n          But now I have finally seen the light.\\n\\nThe admin didn't respond. The console was idle.\\n\\nSitting alone at his Amiga in the dark night on the outskirts of the\\ncity, Mendax laughed aloud. It was just too good not to.\\n\\nFinally, the admin woke up. He began checking the modem lines, one by\\none. If he knew which line the hacker was using, he could simply turn\\noff the modem. Or request a trace on the line.\\n\\nMendax sent another anonymous message to the admin's computer screen:\\n\\n         It's been nice playing with your system.\\n\\nWe didn't do any damage and we even improved a few things. Please\\n        don't call the Australian Federal Police.\\n\\nThe admin ignored the message and continued his search for the hacker.\\nHe ran a program to check which telephone lines were active on the\\nsystem's serial ports, to reveal which dial-up lines were in use. When\\nthe admin saw the carrier detect sign on the line being used by the\\nhacker, Mendax decided it was time to bail out. However, he wanted to\\nmake sure that his call had not been traced, so he lifted the receiver\\nof his telephone, disconnected his modem and waited for the NorTel\\nmodem to hang up first.\\n\\nIf the NorTel admin had set up a last party recall trace to determine\\nwhat phone number the hacker was calling from, Mendax would know. If\\nan LPR trace had been installed, the NorTel end of the telephone\\nconnection would not disconnect but would wait for the hacker's\\ntelephone to hang up first. After 90 seconds, the exchange would log\\nthe phone number where the call had originated.\\n\\nIf, however, the line did not have a trace on it, the company's modem\\nwould search for its lost connection to the hacker's modem. Without\\nthe continuous flow of electronic signals, the NorTel modem would hang\\nup after a few seconds. If no-one reactivated the line at the NorTel\\nend, the connection would time-out 90 seconds later and the telephone\\nexchange would disconnect the call completely.\\n\\nMendax listened anxiously as the NorTel modem searched for his modem\\nby squealing high-pitched noises into the telephone line. No modem\\nhere. Go on, hang up.\\n\\nSuddenly, silence.\\n\\nOK, thought Mendax. Just 90 seconds to go. Just wait here for a minute\\nand a half. Just hope the exchange times out. Just pray there's no\\ntrace.\\n\\nThen someone picked up the telephone at the NorTel end. Mendax\\nstarted. He heard several voices, male and female, in the background.\\nJesus. What were these NorTel people on about? Mendax was so quiet he\\nalmost stopped breathing. There was silence at the receivers on both\\nends of that telephone line. It was a tense waiting game. Mendax heard\\nhis heart racing.\\n\\nA good hacker has nerves of steel. He could stare down the toughest,\\nstony-faced poker player. Most importantly, he never panics. He never\\njust hangs up in a flurry of fear.\\n\\nThen someone in the NorTel office--a woman--said out loud in a\\nconfused voice, `There's nothing there. There's nothing there at all.'\\n\\nShe hung up.\\n\\nMendax waited. He still would not hang up until he was sure there was\\nno trace. Ninety seconds passed before the phone timed out. The fast\\nbeeping of a timed-out telephone connection never sounded so good.\\n\\nMendax sat frozen at his desk as his mind replayed the events of the\\npast half hour again and again. No more NorTel. Way too dangerous. He\\nwas lucky he had escaped unidentified. NorTel had discovered him\\nbefore they could put a trace on the line, but the company would\\nalmost certainly put a trace on the dial-up lines now. NorTel was very\\ntight with Telecom. If anyone could get a trace up quickly, NorTel\\ncould. Mendax had to warn Prime Suspect and Trax.\\n\\nFirst thing in the morning, Mendax rang Trax and told him to stay away\\nfrom NorTel. Then he tried Prime Suspect.\\n\\nThe telephone was engaged.\\n\\nPerhaps Prime Suspect's mother was on the line, chatting. Maybe Prime\\nSuspect was talking to a friend.\\n\\nMendax tried again. And again. And again. He began to get worried.\\nWhat if Prime Suspect was on NorTel at that moment? What if a trace\\nhad been installed? What if they had called in the Feds?\\n\\nMendax phoned Trax and asked if there was any way they could\\nmanipulate the exchange in order to interrupt the call. There wasn't.\\n\\n`Trax, you're the master phreaker,' Mendax pleaded. `Do something.\\nInterrupt the connection. Disconnect him.'\\n\\n`Can't be done. He's on a step-by-step telephone exchange. There's\\nnothing we can do.'\\n\\nNothing? One of Australia's best hacker-phreaker teams couldn't break\\none telephone call. They could take control of whole telephone\\nexchanges but they couldn't interrupt one lousy phone call. Jesus.\\n\\nSeveral hours later, Mendax was able to get through to his fellow IS\\nhacker. It was an abrupt greeting.\\n\\n`Just tell me one thing. Tell me you haven't been in NorTel today?'\\n\\nThere was a long pause before Prime Suspect answered.\\n\\n`I have been in NorTel today.'\\n\\n                \",\n",
       " ' 9 -- Operation Weather.\\n\\n\\nThe world is crashing down on me tonight; The walls are closing in on me tonight.\\n\\n-- from `Outbreak of Love\\', Earth and Sun and Moon.\\n\\nThe AFP was frustrated. A group of hackers were using the Royal\\nMelbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) as a launchpad for hacking\\nattacks on Australian companies, research institutes and a series of\\noverseas sites.\\n\\nDespite their best efforts, the detectives in the AFP\\'s Southern\\nRegion Computer Crimes Unit hadn\\'t been able to determine who was\\nbehind the attacks. They suspected it was a small group of\\nMelbourne-based hackers who worked together. However, there were so\\nmuch hacker activity at RMIT it was difficult to know for sure. There\\ncould have been one organised group, or several. Or perhaps there was\\none small group along with a collection of loners who were making\\nenough noise to distort the picture.\\n\\nStill, it should have been a straightforward operation. The AFP could\\ntrace hackers in this sort of situation with their hands tied behind\\ntheir backs. Arrange for Telecom to whack a last party recall trace on\\nall incoming lines to the RMIT modems. Wait for a hacker to logon,\\nthen isolate which modem he was using. Clip that modem line and wait\\nfor Telecom to trace that line back to its point of origin.\\n\\nHowever, things at RMIT were not working that way. The line traces\\nbegan failing, and not just occasionally. All the time.\\n\\nWhenever RMIT staff found the hackers on-line, they clipped the lines\\nand Telecom began tracking the winding path back to the originating\\nphone number. En route, the trail went dead. It was as if the hackers\\nknew they were being traced ... almost as if they were manipulating\\nthe telephone system to defeat the AFP investigation.\\n\\nThe next generation of hackers seemed to have a new-found\\nsophistication which frustrated AFP detectives at every turn. Then, on\\n13 October 1990, the AFP got lucky. Perhaps the hackers had been lazy\\nthat day, or maybe they just had technical problems using their\\ntraceless phreaking techniques. Prime Suspect couldn\\'t use Trax\\'s\\ntraceless phreaking method from his home because he was on a\\nstep-by-step exchange, and sometimes Trax didn\\'t use the technique.\\nWhatever the reason, Telecom managed to successfully complete two line\\ntraces from RMIT and the AFP now had two addresses and two names.\\nPrime Suspect and Trax.\\n\\n`Hello, Prime Suspect.\\'\\n\\n`Hiya, Mendax. How\\'s tricks?\\'\\n\\n`Good. Did you see that RMIT email? The one in Geoff Huston\\'s\\nmailbox?\\' Mendax walked over to open a window as he spoke. It was\\nspring, 1991, and the weather was unseasonably warm.\\n\\n`I did. Pretty amazing. RMIT looks like it will finally be getting rid\\nof those line traces.\\'\\n\\n`RMIT definitely wants out,\\' Mendax said emphatically.\\n\\n`Yep. Looks like the people at RMIT are sick of Mr Day crawling all\\nover their computers with line traces.\\'\\n\\n`Yeah. That admin at RMIT was pretty good, standing up to AARNET and\\nthe AFP. I figure Geoff Huston must be giving him a hard time.\\'\\n\\n`I bet.\\' Prime Suspect paused. `You reckon the Feds have dropped the\\nline traces for real?\\'\\n\\n`Looks like it. I mean if RMIT kicks them out, there isn\\'t much the\\nFeds can do without the uni\\'s cooperation. The letter sounded like\\nthey just wanted to get on with securing their systems. Hang on. I\\'ve\\ngot it here.\\'\\n\\nMendax pulled up a letter on his computer and scrolled through it.\\n\\nFrom aarnet-contacts-request@jatz.aarnet.edu.au Tue May 28 09:32:31\\n1991\\n\\nReceived: by jatz.aarnet.edu.au id AA07461\\n\\n(5.65+/IDA-1.3.5 for pte900); Tue, 28 May 91 09:31:59 +1000\\n\\nReceived: from possum.ecg.rmit.OZ.AU by jatz.aarnet.edu.au with SMTP\\nid AA07457\\n\\n(5.65+/IDA-1.3.5 for /usr/lib/sendmail -oi -faarnet-contacts-request\\naarnet-contacts-recipients); Tue, 28 May 91 09:31:57 +1000\\n\\nReceived: by possum.ecg.rmit.OZ.AU for aarnet-contacts@aarnet.edu.au)\\n\\nDate: Tue, 28 May 91 09:32:08 +1000\\n\\nFrom: rcoay@possum.ecg.rmit.OZ.AU (Alan Young)\\n\\nMessage-Id: <9105272332.29621@possum.ecg.rmit.OZ.AU>\\n\\nTo: aarnet-contacts@aarnet.edu.au\\n\\nSubject: Re: Hackers\\n\\nStatus: RO\\n\\nWhile no one would disagree that `Hacking\\' is bad and should be\\nstopped, or at least minimised there are several observations which I\\nhave made over the last six or eight months relating to the persuit of\\nthese people:\\n\\n1. The cost involved was significant, we had a CSO working in\\nconjunction with the Commonwealth Police for almost three months full\\ntime.\\n\\n2. While not a criticism of our staff, people lost sight of the ball,\\nthe chase became the most important aspect of the whole exercise.\\n\\n3. Catching Hackers (and charging them) is almost impossible, you have\\nto virtually break into their premises and catch them logged on to an\\nunauthorised machine.\\n\\n4. If you do happen to catch and charge them, the cost of prosecution\\nis high, and a successful outcome is by no ways assured. There may be\\nsome deterrent value in at least catching and prosecuting?\\n\\n5. Continued pursuit of people involved requires doors to be left\\nopen, this unfortunately exposes other sites and has subjected us to\\nsome criticism.\\n\\nThe whole issue is very complex, and in some respects it is a case of\\ndiminishing returns. A fine balance has to be maintained between\\nfreedom, and the prevention of abuse, this appears to be the\\nchallenge.\\n\\nAllan Young\\n\\nRMIT\\n\\n`Yeah, I mean, this RMIT guy is basically saying they are not going to\\ncatch us anyway, so why are they wasting all this time and money?\\'\\n\\n`Yep. The Feds were in there for at least three months,\\' Prime Suspect\\nsaid. `Sounded more like nine months though.\\'\\n\\n`Hmm. Yeah, nothing we didn\\'t know already though.\\'\\n\\n`Pretty obvious, leaving those accounts open all the time like they\\ndid. I reckon that looked pretty suspicious, even if we hadn\\'t gotten\\nthe email.\\'\\n\\n`Definitely,\\' Mendax agreed. `Lots of other hackers in RMIT too. I\\nwonder if they figured it out.\\'\\n\\n`Hmm. They\\'re gonna be screwed if they haven\\'t been careful.\\'\\n\\n`I don\\'t think the Feds have gotten anyone though.\\'\\n\\n`Yeah?\\' Prime Suspect asked.\\n\\n`Well, if they had, why would they leave those accounts open? Why\\nwould RMIT keep a full-time staff person on?\\'\\n\\n`Doesn\\'t make sense.\\'\\n\\n`No,\\' Mendax said. `I\\'d be pretty sure RMIT has kicked them out.\\'\\n\\n`Yeah, told them, \"You had you\\'re chance, boys. Couldn\\'t catch anyone.\\nNow pack your bags\".\\'\\n\\n`Right.\\' Mendax paused. `Don\\'t know about NorTel though.\\'\\n\\n`Mmm, yeah,\\' Prime Suspect said. Then, as usual, a silence began to\\ndescend on the conversation.\\n\\n`Running out of things to say ...\\' Mendax said finally. They were good\\nenough friends for him to be blunt with Prime Suspect.\\n\\n`Yeah.\\'\\n\\nMore silence.\\n\\nMendax thought how strange it was to be such good friends with\\nsomeone, to work so closely with him, and yet to always run out of\\nconversation.\\n\\n`OK, well, I better go. Things to do,\\' Mendax said in a friendly\\nvoice.\\n\\n`Yeah, OK. Bye Mendax,\\' Prime Suspect said cheerfully.\\n\\nMendax hung up.\\n\\nPrime Suspect hung up.\\n\\nAnd the AFP stayed on the line.\\n\\nIn the twelve months following the initial line trace in late 1990,\\nthe AFP continued to monitor the RMIT dial-up lines. The line traces\\nkept failing again and again. But as new reports of hacker attacks\\nrolled in, there seemed to be a discernible pattern in many of the\\nattacks. Detectives began to piece together a picture of their prey.\\n\\nIn 1990 and 1991, RMIT dial-ups and computers were riddled with\\nhackers, many of whom used the university\\'s systems as a nest--a place\\nto store files, and launch further attacks. They frolicked in the\\nsystem almost openly, often using RMIT as a place to chat on-line with\\neach other. The institute served as the perfect launchpad. It was only\\na local phone call away, it had a live Internet connection, a\\nreasonably powerful set of computers and very poor security. Hacker\\nheaven.\\n\\nThe police knew this, and they asked computer staff to keep the\\nsecurity holes open so they could monitor hacker activity. With\\nperhaps a dozen different hackers--maybe more--inside RMIT, the task\\nof isolating a single cell of two or three organised hackers\\nresponsible for the more serious attacks was not going to be easy.\\n\\nBy the middle of 1991, however, there was a growing reluctance among\\nsome RMIT staff to continue leaving their computers wide open. On 28\\nAugust, Allan Young, the head of RMIT\\'s Electronic Communications\\nGroup, told the AFP that the institute wanted to close up the security\\nholes. The AFP did not like this one bit, but when they complained\\nYoung told them, in essence, go talk to Geoff Huston at AARNET and to\\nthe RMIT director.\\n\\nThe AFP was being squeezed out, largely because they had taken so long\\nconducting their investigation. RMIT couldn\\'t reveal the AFP\\ninvestigation to anyone, so it was being embarrassed in front of\\ndozens of other research institutions which assumed it had no idea how\\nto secure its computers. Allan Young couldn\\'t go to a conference with\\nother AARNET representatives without being hassled about `the hacker\\nproblem\\' at RMIT. Meanwhile, his computer staff lost time playing\\ncops-and-robbers--and ignored their real work.\\n\\nHowever, as RMIT prepared to phase out the AFP traps, the police had a\\nlucky break from a different quarter--NorTel. On 16 September, a line\\ntrace from a NorTel dial-up, initiated after a complaint about the\\nhackers to the police, was successful. A fortnight later, on 1\\nOctober, the AFP began tapping Prime Suspect\\'s telephone. The hackers\\nmight be watching the police watch them, but the police were closing\\nin. The taps led back to Trax, and then to someone new--Mendax.\\n\\nThe AFP considered putting taps on Mendax and Trax\\'s telephones as\\nwell. It was a decision to be weighed up carefully. Telephone taps\\nwere expensive, and often needed to be in place for at least a month.\\nThey did, however, provide a reliable record of exactly what the\\nhacker was doing on-line.\\n\\nBefore police could move on setting up additional taps in Operation\\nWeather, the plot took another dramatic turn when one of the IS\\nhackers did something which took the AFP completely by surprise.\\n\\nTrax turned himself in to the police.\\n\\nOn 29 October Prime Suspect was celebrating. His mum had cooked him a\\nnice dinner in honour of finishing his year 12 classes, and then\\ndriven him to Vermont for a swot-vac party. When she arrived back home\\nshe pottered around for an hour and a half, feeding her old dog Lizzy\\nand tidying up. At 11 p.m. she decided to call it a night.\\n\\nNot much later, Lizzy barked.\\n\\n`Are you home so soon?\\' Prime Suspect\\'s mother called out. `Party not\\nmuch fun?\\'\\n\\nNo-one answered.\\n\\nShe sat up in bed. When there was still no answer, her mind raced to\\nreports of a spate of burglaries in the neighbourhood. There had even\\nbeen a few assaults.\\n\\nA muffled male voice came from outside the front door. `Ma\\'am. Open\\nthe door.\\'\\n\\nShe stood up and walked to the front door.\\n\\n`Open the door. Police.\\'\\n\\n`How do I know you\\'re really the police?\\'\\n\\n`If you don\\'t open the door, we\\'ll kick it in!\\' an exasperated male\\nvoice shouted back at her from her front doorstep.\\n\\nPrime Suspect\\'s mother saw the outline of something being pressed\\nagainst the side window. She didn\\'t have her reading glasses on, but\\nit looked like a police badge. Nervously, she opened the front door a\\nlittle bit and looked out.\\n\\nThere were eight or nine people on her doorstep. Before she could stop\\nthem, they had pushed past her, swarming into her home.\\n\\nA female officer began waving a piece of paper about. `Look at this!\\'\\nShe said angrily. `It\\'s a warrant! Can you read it?\\'\\n\\n`No, actually I can\\'t. I don\\'t have my glasses on,\\' Prime Suspect\\'s\\nmother answered curtly.\\n\\nShe told the police she wanted to make a phone call and tried to ring\\nher family solicitor, but without luck. He had been to a funeral and\\nwake and could not be roused. When she reached for the phone a second\\ntime, one of the officers began lecturing her about making more phone\\ncalls.\\n\\n`You be quiet,\\' she said pointing her finger at the officer. Then she\\nmade another unfruitful call.\\n\\nPrime Suspect\\'s mother looked at the police officers, sizing them up.\\nThis was her home. She would show the police to her son\\'s room, as\\nthey requested, but she was not going to allow them to take over the\\nwhole house. As she tartly instructed the police where they could and\\ncould not go, she thought, I\\'m not standing for any nonsense from you\\nboys.\\n\\n`Where\\'s your son?\\' one officer asked her.\\n\\n`At a party.\\'\\n\\n`What is the address?\\'\\n\\nShe eyed him warily. She did not like these officers at all. However,\\nthey would no doubt wait until her son returned anyway, so she handed\\nover the address.\\n\\nWhile the police swarmed though Prime Suspect\\'s room, gathering his\\npapers, computer, modem and other belongings, his mother waited in his\\ndoorway where she could keep an eye on them.\\n\\nSomeone knocked at the door. An AFP officer and Prime Suspect\\'s mother\\nboth went to answer it.\\n\\nIt was the police--the state police.\\n\\nThe next-door neighbours had heard a commotion. When they looked out\\nof their window they saw a group of strange men in street clothes\\nbrazenly taking things from the widow\\'s home as if they owned the\\nplace. So the neighbours did what any responsible person would in the\\ncircumstances. They called the police.\\n\\nThe AFP officers sent the Victoria Police on their way. Then some of\\nthem set off in a plain car for the Vermont party. Wanting to save\\nPrime Suspect some embarrassment in front of his friends, his mother\\nrang him at the party and suggested he wait outside for the AFP.\\n\\nAs soon as Prime Suspect hung up the phone he tried to shake off the\\neffect of a vast quantity of alcohol. When the police pulled up\\noutside, the party was in full swing. Prime Suspect was very drunk,\\nbut he seemed to sober up quite well when the AFP officers introduced\\nthemselves and packed him into the car.\\n\\n`So,\\' said one of the officers as they headed toward his home, `what\\nare you more worried about? What\\'s on your disks or what\\'s in your\\ndesk drawer?\\'\\n\\nPrime Suspect thought hard. What was in his desk drawer? Oh s**t! The\\ndope. He didn\\'t smoke much, just occasionally for fun, but he had a\\ntiny amount of marijuana left over from a party.\\n\\nHe didn\\'t answer. He looked out the window and tried not to look\\nnervous.\\n\\nAt his house, the police asked him if he would agree to an interview.\\n\\n`I don\\'t think so. I\\'m feeling a little ... under the weather at the\\nmoment,\\' he said. Doing a police interview would be difficult enough.\\nDoing it drunk would be just plain dangerous.\\n\\nAfter the police carted away the last of his hacking gear, Prime\\nSuspect signed the official seizure forms and watched them drive off\\nin to the night.\\n\\nReturning to his bedroom, he sat down, distracted, and tried to gather\\nhis thoughts. Then he remembered the dope. He opened his desk drawer.\\nIt was still there. Funny people, these feds.\\n\\nThen again, maybe it made sense. Why would they bother with some tiny\\namount of dope that was hardly worth the paperwork? His nervousness\\nover a couple of joints must have seemed laughable to the feds. They\\nhad just seized enough evidence of hacking to lock him up for years,\\ndepending on the judge, and here he was sweating about a thimbleful of\\nmarijuana which might land him a $100 fine.\\n\\nAs the late spring night began to cool down, Prime Suspect wondered\\nwhether the AFP had raided Mendax and Trax.\\n\\nAt the party, before the police had shown up, he had tried to ring\\nMendax. From his mother\\'s description when she called him, it sounded\\nas if the entire federal police force was in his house at that moment.\\nWhich could mean that only one other IS hacker had gone down at the\\nsame time. Unless he was the last to be raided, Mendax or Trax might\\nstill be unaware of what was happening.\\n\\nAs he waited for the police to pick him up, a very drunk Prime Suspect\\ntried to ring Mendax again. Busy. He tried again. And again. The\\nmaddening buzz of an engaged signal only made Prime Suspect more\\nnervous.\\n\\nThere was no way to get through, no way to warn him.\\n\\nPrime Suspect wondered whether the police had actually shown up at\\nMendax\\'s and whether, if he had been able to get through, his phone\\ncall would have made any difference at all.\\n\\n\\nThe house looked like it had been ransacked. It had been ransacked, by\\nMendax\\'s wife, on her way out. Half the furniture was missing, and the\\nother half was in disarray. Dresser drawers hung open with their\\ncontents removed, and clothing lay scattered around the room.\\n\\nWhen his wife left him, she didn\\'t just take their toddler child. She\\ntook a number of things which had sentimental value to Mendax. When\\nshe insisted on taking the CD player she had given him for his\\ntwentieth birthday just a few months before, he asked her to leave a\\nlock of her hair behind for him in its place. He still couldn\\'t\\nbelieve his wife of three years had packed up and left him.\\n\\nThe last week of October had been a bad one for Mendax. Heartbroken,\\nhe had sunk into a deep depression. He hadn\\'t eaten properly for days,\\nhe drifted in and out of a tortured sleep, and he had even lost the\\ndesire to use his computer. His prized hacking disks, filled with\\nhighly incriminating stolen computer access codes, were normally\\nstored in a secure hiding place. But on the evening of 29 October\\n1991, thirteen disks were strewn around his $700 Amiga 500. A\\nfourteenth disk was in the computer\\'s disk drive.\\n\\nMendax sat on a couch reading Soledad Brother, the prison\\nletters from George Jackson\\'s nine-year stint in one of the toughest\\nprisons in the US. Convicted for a petty crime, Jackson was supposed\\nto be released after a short sentence but was kept in the prison at\\nthe governor\\'s pleasure. The criminal justice system kept him on a\\nmerry-go-round of hope and despair as the authorities dragged their\\nfeet. Later, prison guards shot and killed Jackson. The book was one\\nof Mendax\\'s favourites, but it offered little distraction from his\\nunhappiness.\\n\\nThe droning sound of a telephone fault signal--like a busy\\nsignal--filled the house. Mendax had hooked up his stereo speakers to\\nhis modem and computer, effectively creating a speaker phone so he\\ncould listen to tones he piped from his computer into the telephone\\nline and the ones which came back from the exchange in reply. It was\\nperfect for using Trax\\'s MFC phreaking methods.\\n\\nMendax also used the system for scanning. Most of the time, he picked\\ntelephone prefixes in the Melbourne CBD. When his modem hit another,\\nMendax would rush to his computer and note the telephone number for\\nfuture hacking exploration.\\n\\nBy adjusting the device, he could also make it simulate a phreaker\\'s\\nblack box. The box would confuse the telephone exchange into thinking\\nhe had not answered his phone, thus allowing Mendax\\'s friends to call\\nhim for free for 90 seconds.\\n\\nOn this night, however, the only signal Mendax was sending out was\\nthat he wanted to be left alone. He hadn\\'t been calling any computer\\nsystems. The abandoned phone, with no connection to a remote modem,\\nhad timed out and was beeping off the hook.\\n\\nIt was strange behaviour for someone who had spent most of his teenage\\nyears trying to connect to the outside world through telephone lines\\nand computers, but Mendax had listened all day to the hypnotic sound\\nof a phone off the hook resonating through each room. BEEEP. Pause.\\nBEEEP. Pause. Endlessly.\\n\\nA loud knock at the door punctured the stereo thrum of the phone.\\n\\nMendax looked up from his book to see a shadowy figure through the\\nfrosted glass panes of the front door. The figure was quite short. It\\nlooked remarkably like Ratface, an old school friend of Mendax\\'s wife\\nand a character known for his practical jokes.\\n\\nMendax called out, `Who is it?\\' without moving from the sofa.\\n\\n`Police. Open up.\\'\\n\\nYeah, sure. At 11.30 p.m.? Mendax rolled his eyes toward the door.\\nEveryone knew that the police only raid your house in the early\\nmorning, when they know you are asleep and vulnerable.\\n\\nMendax dreamed of police raids all the time. He dreamed of footsteps\\ncrunching on the driveway gravel, of shadows in the pre-dawn darkness,\\nof a gun-toting police squad bursting through his backdoor at 5 a.m.\\nHe dreamed of waking from a deep sleep to find several police officers\\nstanding over his bed. The dreams were very disturbing. They\\naccentuated his growing paranoia that the police were watching him,\\nfollowing him.\\n\\nThe dreams had become so real that Mendax often became agitated in the\\ndead hour before dawn. At the close of an all-night hacking session,\\nhe would begin to feel very tense, very strung out. It was not until\\nthe computer disks, filled with stolen computer files from his hacking\\nadventures, were stored safely in their hiding place that he would\\nbegin to calm down.\\n\\n`Go away, Ratface, I\\'m not in the mood,\\' Mendax said, returning to his\\nbook.\\n\\nThe voice became louder, more insistent, `Police. Open the door. NOW\\'.\\nOther figures were moving around behind the glass, shoving police\\nbadges and guns against the window pane. Hell. It really was the\\npolice!\\n\\nMendax\\'s heart started racing. He asked the police to show him their\\nsearch warrant. They obliged immediately, pressing it against the\\nglass as well. Mendax opened the door to find nearly a dozen\\nplain-clothes police waiting for him.\\n\\n`I don\\'t believe this,\\' he said in a bewildered voice `My wife just\\nleft me. Can\\'t you come back later?\\'\\n\\nAt the front of the police entourage was Detective Sergeant Ken Day,\\nhead of the AFP\\'s Computer Crimes Unit in the southern region. The two\\nknew all about each other, but had never met in person. Day spoke\\nfirst.\\n\\n`I\\'m Ken Day. I believe you\\'ve been expecting me.\\'\\n\\nMendax and his fellow IS hackers had been expecting the AFP. For weeks\\nthey had been intercepting electronic mail suggesting that the police\\nwere closing the net. So when Day turned up saying, `I believe you\\'ve\\nbeen expecting me,\\' he was completing the information circle. The\\ncircle of the police watching the hackers watching the police watch\\nthem.\\n\\nIt\\'s just that Mendax didn\\'t expect the police at that particular\\nmoment. His mind was a tangle and he looked in disbelief at the band\\nof officers on his front step. Dazed, he looked at Day and then spoke\\nout loud, as if talking to himself, `But you\\'re too short to be a\\ncop.\\'\\n\\nDay looked surprised. `Is that meant to be an insult?\\' he said.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t. Mendax was in denial and it wasn\\'t until the police had\\nslipped past him into the house that the reality of the situation\\nslowly began to sink in. Mendax\\'s mind started to work again.\\n\\nThe disks. The damn disks. The beehive.\\n\\nAn avid apiarist, Mendax kept his own hive. Bees fascinated him. He\\nliked to watch them interact, to see their sophisticated social\\nstructure. So it was with particular pleasure that he enlisted their\\nhelp in hiding his hacking activities. For months he had meticulously\\nsecreted the disks in the hive. It was the ideal location--unlikely,\\nand well guarded by 60000 flying things with stings. Though he hadn\\'t\\nbought the hive specifically for hiding stolen computer account\\npasswords for the likes of the US Air Force 7th Command Group in the\\nPentagon, it appeared to be a secure hiding place.\\n\\nHe had replaced the cover of the super box, which housed the\\nhoneycomb, with a sheet of coloured glass so he could watch the bees\\nat work. In summer, he put a weather protector over the glass. The\\nwhite plastic cover had raised edges and could be fastened securely to\\nthe glass sheet with metal clasps. As Mendax considered his\\nimprovements to the bee box, he realised that this hive could provide\\nmore than honey. He carefully laid out the disks between the glass and\\nthe weather protector. They fitted perfectly in the small gap.\\n\\nMendax had even trained the bees not to attack him as he removed and\\nreplaced the disks every day. He collected sweat from his armpits on\\ntissues and then soaked the tissues in a sugar water solution. He fed\\nthis sweaty nectar to the bees. Mendax wanted the bees to associate\\nhim with flowers instead of a bear, the bees\\' natural enemy.\\n\\nBut on the evening of the AFP raid Mendax\\'s incriminating disks were\\nin full view on the computer table and the officers headed straight\\nfor them. Ken Day couldn\\'t have hoped for better evidence. The disks\\nwere full of stolen userlists, encrypted passwords, cracked passwords,\\nmodem telephone numbers, documents revealing security flaws in various\\ncomputer systems, and details of the AFP\\'s own investigation--all from\\ncomputer systems Mendax had penetrated illegally.\\n\\nMendax\\'s problems weren\\'t confined to the beehive disks. The last\\nthing he had done on the computer the day before was still on screen.\\nIt was a list of some 1500 accounts, their passwords, the dates that\\nMendax had obtained them and a few small notes beside each one.\\n\\nThe hacker stood to the side as the police and two Telecom Protective\\nServices officers swarmed through the house. They photographed his\\ncomputer equipment and gathered up disks, then ripped up the carpet so\\nthey could videotape the telephone cord running to his modem. They\\nscooped up every book, no small task since Mendax was an avid reader,\\nand held each one upside down looking for hidden computer passwords on\\nloose pieces of paper. They grabbed every bit of paper with\\nhandwriting on it and poured through his love letters, notebooks and\\nprivate diaries. `We don\\'t care how long it takes to do this job,\\' one\\ncop quipped. `We\\'re getting paid overtime. And danger money.\\'\\n\\nThe feds even riffled through Mendax\\'s collection of old Scientific\\nAmerican and New Scientist magazines. Maybe they thought he had\\nunderlined a word somewhere and turned it into a passphrase for an\\nencryption program.\\n\\nOf course, there was only one magazine the feds really wanted:\\nInternational Subversive. They scooped up every print-out of the\\nelectronic journal they could find.\\n\\nAs Mendax watched the federal police sift through his possessions and\\ndisassemble his computer room, an officer who had some expertise with\\nAmigas arrived. He told Mendax to get the hell out of the computer\\nroom.\\n\\nMendax didn\\'t want to leave the room. He wasn\\'t under arrest and\\nwanted to make sure the police didn\\'t plant anything. So he looked at\\nthe cop and said, `This is my house and I want to stay in this room.\\nAm I under arrest or not?\\'\\n\\nThe cop snarled back at him, `Do you want to be under arrest?\\'\\n\\nMendax acquiesced and Day, who was far more subtle in his approach,\\nwalked the hacker into another room for questioning. He turned to\\nMendax and asked, with a slight grin, `So, what\\'s it like being\\nbusted? Is it like Nom told you?\\'\\n\\nMendax froze.\\n\\nThere were only two ways that Day could have known Nom had told Mendax\\nabout his bust. Nom might have told him, but this was highly unlikely.\\nNom\\'s hacking case had not yet gone to court and Nom wasn\\'t exactly on\\nchummy terms with the police. The other alternative was that the AFP\\nhad been tapping telephones in Mendax\\'s circle of hackers, which the\\nIS trio had strongly suspected. Talking in a three-way phone\\nconversation with Mendax and Trax, Nom had relayed the story of his\\nbust. Mendax later relayed Nom\\'s story to Prime Suspect--also on the\\nphone. Harbouring suspicions is one thing. Having them confirmed by a\\nsenior AFP officer is quite another.\\n\\nDay pulled out a tape recorder, put it on the table, turned it on and\\nbegan asking questions. When Mendax told Day he wouldn\\'t answer him,\\nDay turned the recorder off. `We can talk off the record if you want,\\'\\nhe told the hacker.\\n\\nMendax nearly laughed out loud. Police were not journalists. There was\\nno such thing as an off-the-record conversation between a suspect and\\na police officer.\\n\\nMendax asked to speak to a lawyer. He said he wanted to call\\nAlphaline, a free after-hours legal advice telephone service. Day\\nagreed, but when he picked up the telephone to inspect it before\\nhanding it over to Mendax, something seemed amiss. The phone had an\\nunusual, middle-pitched tone which Day didn\\'t seem to recognise.\\nDespite there being two Telecom employees and numerous police\\nspecialists in the house, Day appeared unable to determine the cause\\nof the funny tone. He looked Mendax dead in the eye and said, `Is this\\na hijacked telephone line?\\'\\n\\nHijacked? Day\\'s comment took Mendax by surprise. What surprised him\\nwas not that Day suspected him of hijacking the line, but rather that\\nhe didn\\'t know whether the line had been manipulated.\\n\\n`Well, don\\'t you know?\\' he taunted Day.\\n\\nFor the next half hour, Day and the other officers picked apart\\nMendax\\'s telephone, trying to work out what sort of shenanigans the\\nhacker had been up to. They made a series of calls to see if the\\nlong-haired youth had somehow rewired his telephone line, perhaps to\\nmake his calls untraceable.\\n\\nIn fact, the dial tone on Mendax\\'s telephone was the very normal sound\\nof a tone-dial telephone on an ARE-11 telephone exchange. The tone was\\nsimply different from the ones generated by other exchange types, such\\nas AXE and step-by-step exchanges.\\n\\nFinally Mendax was allowed to call a lawyer at Alphaline. The lawyer\\nwarned the hacker not to say anything. He said the police could offer\\na sworn statement to the court about anything the hacker said, and\\nthen added that the police might even be wired.\\n\\nNext, Day tried the chummy approach at getting information from the\\nhacker. `Just between you and me, are you Mendax?\\' he asked.\\n\\nSilence.\\n\\nDay tried another tactic. Hackers have a well-developed sense of\\nego--a flaw Day no doubt believed he could tap into.\\n\\n`There have been a lot of people over the years running around\\nimpersonating you--using your handle,\\' he said.\\n\\nMendax could see Day was trying to manipulate him but by this stage he\\ndidn\\'t care. He figured that the police already had plenty of evidence\\nthat linked him to his handle, so he admitted to it.\\n\\nDay had some other surprising questions up his sleeve.\\n\\n`So, Mendax, what do you know about that white powder in the bedroom?\\'\\n\\nMendax couldn\\'t recall any white powder in the bedroom. He didn\\'t do\\ndrugs, so why would there be any white powder anywhere? He watched two\\npolice officers bringing two large red toolboxes in the house--they\\nlooked like drug testing kits. Jesus, Mendax thought. I\\'m being set\\nup.\\n\\nThe cops led the hacker into the bedroom and pointed to two neat lines\\nof white powder laid out on a bench.\\n\\nMendax smiled, relieved. `It\\'s not what you think,\\' he said. The white\\npowder was glow-in-the-dark glue he had used to paint stars on the\\nceiling of his child\\'s bedroom.\\n\\nTwo of the cops started smiling at each other. Mendax could see\\nexactly what was going through their minds: It\\'s not every cocaine or\\nspeed user that can come up with a story like that.\\n\\nOne grinned at the other and exclaimed gleefully, `TASTE TEST!\\'\\n\\n`That\\'s not a good idea,\\' Mendax said, but his protests only made\\nthings worse. The cops shooed him into another room and returned to\\ninspect the powder by themselves.\\n\\nWhat Mendax really wanted was to get word through to Prime Suspect.\\nThe cops had probably busted all three IS hackers at the same time,\\nbut maybe not. While the police investigated the glue on their own,\\nMendax managed to sneak a telephone call to his estranged wife and\\nasked her to call Prime Suspect and warn him. He and his wife might\\nhave had their differences, but he figured she would make the call\\nanyway.\\n\\nWhen Mendax\\'s wife reached Prime Suspect later that night, he replied,\\n`Yeah, there\\'s a party going on over here too.\\'\\n\\nMendax went back in to the kitchen where an officer was tagging the\\ngrowing number of possessions seized by the police. One of the female\\nofficers was struggling to move his printer to the pile. She smiled\\nsweetly at Mendax and asked if he would move it for her. He obliged.\\n\\nThe police finally left Mendax\\'s house at about 3 a.m. They had spent\\nthree and half hours and seized 63 bundles of his personal belongings,\\nbut they had not charged him with a single crime.\\n\\nWhen the last of the unmarked police cars had driven away, Mendax\\nstepped out into the silent suburban street. He looked around. After\\nmaking sure that no-one was watching him, he walked to a nearby phone\\nbooth and rang Trax.\\n\\n`The AFP raided my house tonight.\\' he warned his friend. `They just\\nleft.\\'\\n\\nTrax sounded odd, awkward. `Oh. Ah. I see.\\'\\n\\n`Is there something wrong? You sound strange,\\' Mendax said.\\n\\n`Ah. No ... no, nothing\\'s wrong. Just um ... tired. So, um ... so the\\nfeds could ... ah, be here any minute ...\\' Trax\\'s voice trailed off.\\n\\nBut something was very wrong. The AFP were already at Trax\\'s house,\\nand they had been there for 10 hours.\\n\\nThe IS hackers waited almost three years to be charged. The threat of\\ncriminal charges hung over their heads like personalised Swords of\\nDamocles. They couldn\\'t apply for a job, make a friend at TAFE or plan\\nfor the future without worrying about what would happen as a result of\\nthe AFP raids of 29 October 1991.\\n\\nFinally, in July 1994, each hacker received formal charges--in the\\nmail. During the intervening years, all three hackers went through\\nmonumental changes in their lives.\\n\\nDevastated by the break-down of his marriage and unhinged by the AFP\\nraid, Mendax sank into a deep depression and consuming anger. By the\\nmiddle of November 1991, he was admitted to hospital.\\n\\nHe hated hospital, its institutional regimens and game-playing\\nshrinks. Eventually, he told the doctors he wanted out. He might be\\ncrazy, but hospital was definitely making him crazier. He left there\\nand stayed at his mother\\'s house. The next year was the worst of his\\nlife.\\n\\nOnce a young person leaves home--particularly the home of a\\nstrong-willed parent--it becomes very difficult for him or her to\\nreturn. Short visits might work, but permanent residency often fails.\\nMendax lived for a few days at home, then went walkabout. He slept in\\nthe open air, on the banks of rivers and creeks, in grassy\\nmeadows--all on the country fringes of Melbourne\\'s furthest suburbs.\\nSometimes he travelled closer to the city, overnighting in places like\\nthe Merri Creek reserve.\\n\\nMostly, he haunted Sherbrooke Forest in the Dandenong Ranges National\\nPark. Because of the park\\'s higher elevation, the temperature dropped\\nwell below the rest of Melbourne in winter. In summer, the mosquitoes\\nwere unbearable and Mendax sometimes woke to find his face swollen and\\nbloated from their bites.\\n\\nFor six months after the AFP raid, Mendax didn\\'t touch a computer.\\nSlowly, he started rebuilding his life from the ground up. By the time\\nthe AFP\\'s blue slips--carrying 29 charges--arrived in July 1994, he\\nwas settled in a new house with his child. Throughout his period of\\ntransition, he talked to Prime Suspect and Trax on the phone\\nregularly--as friends and fellow rebels, not fellow hackers. Prime\\nSuspect had been going through his own set of problems.\\n\\nWhile he hacked, Prime Suspect didn\\'t do many drugs. A little weed,\\nnot much else. There was no time for drugs, girls, sports or anything\\nelse. After the raid, he gave up hacking and began smoking more dope.\\nIn April 1992, he tried ecstasy for the first time--and spent the next\\nnine months trying to find the same high. He didn\\'t consider himself\\naddicted to drugs, but the drugs had certainly replaced his addiction\\nto hacking and his life fell into a rhythm.\\n\\nSnort some speed or pop an ecstasy tablet on Saturday night. Go to a\\nrave. Dance all night, sometimes for six hours straight. Get home\\nmid-morning and spend Sunday coming down from the drugs. Get high on\\ndope a few times during the week, to dull the edges of desire for the\\nmore expensive drugs. When Saturday rolled around, do it all over\\nagain. Week in, week out. Month after month.\\n\\nDancing to techno-music released him. Dancing to it on drugs cleared\\nhis mind completely, made him feel possessed by the music. Techno was\\nmusical nihilism; no message, and not much medium either. Fast,\\nrepetitive, computer-synthesised beats, completely stripped of vocals\\nor any other evidence of humanity. He liked to go to techno-night at\\nThe Lounge, a city club, where people danced by themselves, or in\\nsmall, loose groups of four or five. Everyone watched the video screen\\nwhich provided an endless stream of ever-changing, colourful\\ncomputer-generated geometric shapes pulsing to the beat.\\n\\nPrime Suspect never told his mother he was going to a rave. He just\\nsaid he was going to a friend\\'s for the night. In between the drugs,\\nhe attended his computer science courses at TAFE and worked at the\\nlocal supermarket so he could afford his weekly $60 ecstasy tablet,\\n$20 rave entry fee and regular baggy of marijuana.\\n\\nOver time, the drugs became less and less fun. Then, one Sunday, he\\ncame down off some speed hard. A big crash. The worst he had ever\\nexperienced. Depression set in, and then paranoia. He knew the police\\nwere still watching him. They had followed him before.\\n\\nAt his police interviews, he learned that an AFP officer had followed\\nhim to an AC/DC concert less than two weeks before he had been busted.\\nThe officer told him the AFP wanted to know what sort of friends Prime\\nSuspect associated with--and the officer had been treated to the spectre\\nof seven other arm-waving, head-thumping, screaming teenagers just like\\nPrime Suspect himself.\\n\\nNow Prime Suspect believed that the AFP had started following him\\nagain. They were going to raid him again, even though he had given up\\nhacking completely. It didn\\'t make sense. He knew the premonition was\\nillogical, but he couldn\\'t shake it.\\n\\nSomething bad--very, very bad--was going to happen any day. Overcome\\nwith a great sense of impending doom, he lapsed into a sort of\\nhysterical depression. Feeling unable to prevent the advent of the\\ndark, terrible event which would tear apart his life yet again, he\\nreached out to a friend who had experienced his own personal problems.\\nThe friend guided him to a psychologist at the Austin Hospital. Prime\\nSuspect decided that there had to be a better way to deal with his\\nproblems than wasting himself every weekend. He began counselling.\\n\\nThe counselling made him deal with all sorts of unresolved business.\\nHis father\\'s death. His relationship with his mother. How he had\\nevolved into an introvert, and why he was never comfortable talking to\\npeople. Why he hacked. How he became addicted to hacking. Why he took\\nup drugs.\\n\\nAt the end, the 21-year-old Prime Suspect emerged drug-free and,\\nthough still shaky, on the road to recovery. The worst he had to wait\\nfor were the charges from the AFP.\\n\\nTrax\\'s recovery from his psychological instabilities wasn\\'t as\\ndefinitive. From 1985, Trax had suffered from panic attacks, but he\\ndidn\\'t want to seek professional help--he just ran away from the\\nproblem. The situation only became worse after he was involved in a\\nserious car accident. He became afraid to leave the house at night. He\\ncouldn\\'t drive. Whenever he was in a car, he had to fight an\\noverwhelming desire to fling the door open and throw himself out on to\\nthe road. In 1989, his local GP referred Trax to a psychiatrist, who\\ntried to treat the phreaker\\'s growing anxiety attacks with hypnosis\\nand relaxation techniques.\\n\\nTrax\\'s illness degenerated into full-fledged agoraphobia, a fear of\\nopen spaces. When he rang the police in late October 1991--just days\\nbefore the AFP raid--his condition had deteriorated to the point where\\nhe could not comfortably leave his own house.\\n\\nInitially he rang the state police to report a death threat made\\nagainst him by another phreaker. Somewhere in the conversation, he\\nbegan to talk about his own phreaking and hacking. He hadn\\'t intended\\nto turn himself in but, well, the more he talked, the more he had to\\nsay. So many things had been weighing on his mind. He knew that Prime\\nSuspect had probably been traced from NorTel as a result of Mendax\\'s\\nown near miss in that system. And Prime Suspect and Mendax had been so\\nactive, breaking into so many systems, it was almost as if they wanted\\nto be caught.\\n\\nThen there was Prime Suspect\\'s plan to write a destructive worm, which\\nwould wipe systems en route. It wasn\\'t really a plan per se, more just\\nan idea he had toyed with on the phone. Nonetheless, it had scared\\nTrax. He began to think all three IS hackers were getting in too deep\\nand he wanted out.\\n\\nHe tried to stop phreaking, even going so far as to ask Telecom to\\nchange his telephone number to a new exchange which he knew would not\\nallow him to make untraceable calls. Trax reasoned that if he knew he\\ncould be traced, he would stop phreaking and hacking.\\n\\nFor a period, he did stop. But the addiction was too strong, and\\nbefore long he was back at it again, regardless of the risk. He ran a\\nhidden cable from his sister\\'s telephone line, which was on the old\\nexchange. His inability to stop made him feel weak and guilty, and\\neven more anxious about the risks. Perhaps the death threat threw him\\nover the edge. He couldn\\'t really understand why he had turned himself\\nin to the police. It had just sort of happened.\\n\\nThe Victoria Police notified the AFP. The AFP detectives must have\\nbeen slapping their heads in frustration. Here was Australia\\'s next\\nbig hacker case after The Realm, and they had expected to make a clean\\nbust. They had names, addresses, phone numbers. They had jumped\\nthrough legal hoops to get a telephone tap. The tap was up and\\nrunning, catching every target computer, every plot, every word the\\nhackers said to each other. Then one of their targets goes and turns\\nhimself in to the police. And not even to the right police--he goes to\\nthe Victoria Police. In one fell swoop, the hacker was going to take\\ndown the entire twelve-month Operation Weather investigation.\\n\\nThe AFP had to move quickly. If Trax tipped off the other two IS\\nhackers that he had called the police, they might destroy their notes,\\ncomputer files--all the evidence the AFP had hoped to seize in raids.\\n\\nWhen the AFP swooped in on the three hackers, Mendax and Prime Suspect\\nhad refused to be interviewed on the night. Trax, however, had spent\\nseveral hours talking to the police at his house.\\n\\nHe told the other IS hackers that the police had threatened to take\\nhim down to AFP headquarters--despite the fact that they knew leaving\\nhis house caused him anxiety. Faced with that prospect, made so\\nterrifying by his psychiatric illness, he had talked.\\n\\nPrime Suspect and Mendax didn\\'t know how much Trax had told the\\npolice, but they didn\\'t believe he would dob them in completely. Apart\\nfrom anything else, he hadn\\'t been privy to much of his colleagues\\'\\nhacking. They hadn\\'t tried to exclude Trax, but he was not as\\nsophisticated a hacker and therefore didn\\'t share in many of their\\nexploits.\\n\\nIn fact, one thing Trax did tell the police was just how sophisticated\\nthe other two IS hackers had become just prior to the bust. Prime\\nSuspect and Mendax were, he said, `hackers on a major scale, on a huge\\nscale--something never achieved before\\', and the AFP had sat up and\\ntaken notice.\\n\\nAfter the raids, Trax told Mendax that the AFP had tried to recruit\\nhim as an informant. Trax said that they had even offered him a new\\ncomputer system, but he had been non-committal. And it seemed the AFP\\nwas still keeping tabs on the IS hackers, Trax also told Mendax. The\\nAFP officers had heard Mendax had gone into hospital and they were\\nworried. There seemed to be a disturbing pattern evolving.\\n\\nOn the subject of the IS raids, Trax told Mendax that the AFP felt it\\ndidn\\'t have any choice. Their attitude was: you were doing so much, we\\nhad to bust you. You were inside so many systems, it was getting out\\nof control.\\n\\nIn any case, by December 1991 Mendax had agreed to a police interview,\\nbased on legal advice. Ken Day interviewed Mendax, and the hacker was\\nopen with Day about what he had done. He refused, however, to\\nimplicate either Trax or Prime Suspect. In February 1992, Prime\\nSuspect followed suit, with two interviews. He was also careful about\\nwhat he said regarding his fellow hackers. Mendax was interviewed a\\nsecond time, in February 1992, as was Trax in August.\\n\\nAfter the raid, Trax\\'s psychiatric condition remained unstable. He\\nchanged doctors and began receiving home visits from a hospital\\npsychiatric service. Eventually, a doctor prescribed medication.\\n\\nThe three hackers continued to talk on the phone, and see each other\\noccasionally. One or the other might drop out of communication for a\\nperiod, but would soon return to the fold. They helped each other and\\nthey maintained their deep anti-establishment sentiments.\\n\\nAfter the charges arrived in the mail, they called each other to\\ncompare notes. Mendax thought out loud on the phone to Prime Suspect,\\n`I guess I should get a lawyer\\'.\\n\\n`Yeah. I got one. He\\'s lining up a barrister too.\\'\\n\\n`They any good?\\' Mendax asked.\\n\\n`Dunno. I guess so. The solicitor works at Legal Aid, an in-house guy.\\nI\\'ve only met them a few times.\\'\\n\\n`Oh,\\' Mendax paused. `What are their names?\\'\\n\\n`John McLoughlin and Boris Kayser. They did Electron\\'s case.\\'\\n\\nTrax and Prime Suspect decided to plead guilty. Once they saw the\\noverwhelming evidence--data taps, telephone voice taps, data seized\\nduring the raids, nearly a dozen statements by witnesses from the\\norganisations they had hacked, the 300-page Telecom report--they\\nfigured they would be better off pleading. The legal brief ran to more\\nthan 7000 pages. At least they would get some kudos with the judge for\\ncooperating in the police interviews and pleading early in the\\nprocess, thus saving the court time and money.\\n\\nMendax, however, wanted to fight the charges. He knew about Pad and\\nGandalf\\'s case and the message from that seemed to be pretty clear:\\nPlead and you go to prison, fight and you might get off free.\\n\\nThe DPP shuffled the charges around so much between mid-1994 and 1995\\nthat all the original charges against Trax, issued on 20 July 1994,\\nwere dropped in favour of six new charges filed on Valentines Day,\\n1995. At that time, new charges--largely for hacking a Telecom\\ncomputer--were also laid against Mendax and Prime Suspect.\\n\\nBy May 1995, the three hackers faced 63 charges in all: 31 for Mendax,\\n26 for Prime Suspect and six for Trax. In addition, NorTel claimed the\\ndamages attributed to the hacker incident totalled about $160000--and\\nthe company was seeking compensation from the responsible parties. The\\nAustralian National University claimed another $4200 in damages.\\n\\nMost of the charges related to obtaining illegal access to commercial\\nor other information, and inserting and deleting data in numerous\\ncomputers. The deleting of data was not malicious--it generally\\nrelated to cleaning up evidence of the hackers\\' activities. However,\\nall three hackers were also charged with some form of `incitement\\'. By\\nwriting articles for the IS magazine, the prosecution claimed the\\nhackers had been involved in disseminating information which would\\nencourage others to hack and phreak.\\n\\nOn 4 May 1995 Mendax sat in the office of his solicitor, Paul\\nGalbally, discussing the committal hearing scheduled for the next day.\\n\\nGalbally was a young, well-respected member of Melbourne\\'s most\\nprestigious law family. His family tree read like a Who\\'s Who of the\\nlaw. Frank Galbally, his father, was one of Australia\\'s most famous\\ncriminal barristers. His uncle, Jack Galbally, was a well-known\\nlawyer, a minister in the State Labor government of John Cain Sr and,\\nlater, the Leader of the Opposition in the Victorian parliament. His\\nmaternal grandfather, Sir Norman O\\'Bryan, was a Supreme Court judge,\\nas was his maternal uncle of the same name. The Galballys weren\\'t so\\nmuch a family of lawyers as a legal dynasty.\\n\\nRather than rest on his family\\'s laurels, Paul Galbally worked out of\\na cramped, 1970s time-warped, windowless office in a William Street\\nbasement, where he was surrounded by defence briefs--the only briefs\\nhe accepted. He liked the idea of keeping people out of prison better\\nthan the idea of putting them in it. Working closely with a defendant,\\nhe inevitably found redeeming qualities which the prosecution would\\nnever see. Traces of humanity, no matter how small, made his choice\\nseem worthwhile.\\n\\nHis choices in life reflected the Galbally image as champions of the\\nunderdog, and the family shared a background with the working class.\\nCatholic. Irish. Collingwood football enthusiasts. And, of course, a\\nvery large family. Paul was one of eight children, and his father had\\nalso come from a large family.\\n\\nThe 34-year-old criminal law specialist didn\\'t know anything about\\ncomputer crime when Mendax first appeared in his office, but the\\nhacker\\'s case seemed both interesting and worthy. The unemployed,\\nlong-haired youth had explained he could only offer whatever fees the\\nVictorian Legal Aid Commission was willing to pay--a sentence Galbally\\nheard often in his practice. He agreed.\\n\\nGalbally & O\\'Bryan had a very good reputation as a criminal law firm.\\nCriminals, however, tended not to have a great deal of money. The\\nlarge commercial firms might dabble in some criminal work, but they\\ncushioned any resulting financial inconvenience with other, more\\nprofitable legal work. Pushing paper for Western Mining Corporation\\npaid for glass-enclosed corner offices on the fiftieth floor.\\nDefending armed robbers and drug addicts didn\\'t.\\n\\nThe 4 May meeting between Galbally and Mendax was only scheduled to\\ntake an hour or so. Although Mendax was contesting the committal\\nhearing along with Prime Suspect on the following day, it was Prime\\nSuspect\\'s barrister, Boris Kayser, who was going to be running the\\nshow. Prime Suspect told Mendax he had managed to get full Legal Aid\\nfor the committal, something Galbally and Mendax had not been able to\\nprocure. Thus Mendax would not have his own barrister at the\\nproceedings.\\n\\nMendax didn\\'t mind. Both hackers knew they would be committed to\\ntrial. Their immediate objective was to discredit the prosecution\\'s\\ndamage claims--particularly NorTel\\'s.\\n\\nAs Mendax and Galbally talked, the mood in the office was upbeat.\\nMendax was feeling optimistic. Then the phone rang. It was Geoff\\nChettle, the barrister representing the DPP. While Chettle talked,\\nMendax watched a dark cloud pass across his solicitor\\'s face. When he\\nfinally put the phone down, Galbally looked at Mendax with his serious,\\ncrisis management expression.\\n\\n`What\\'s wrong? What\\'s the matter?\\' Mendax asked.\\n\\nGalbally sighed before he spoke.\\n\\n`Prime Suspect has turned Crown witness against you.\\'\\n\\nThere was a mistake. Mendax was sure of it. The whole thing was just\\none big mistake. Maybe Chettle and the DPP had misunderstood something\\nPrime Suspect had said to them. Maybe Prime Suspect\\'s lawyers had\\nmessed up. Whatever. There was definitely a mistake.\\n\\nAt Galbally\\'s office, Mendax had refused to believe Prime Suspect had\\nreally turned. Not until he saw a signed statement. That night he told\\na friend, `Well, we\\'ll see. Maybe Chettle is just playing it up.\\'\\n\\nChettle, however, was not just playing it up.\\n\\nThere it was--a witness statement--in front of him. Signed by Prime\\nSuspect.\\n\\nMendax stood outside the courtroom at Melbourne Magistrates Court trying\\nto reconcile two realities. In the first, there was one of Mendax\\'s four\\nor five closest friends. A friend with whom he had shared his deepest\\nhacking secrets.  A friend he had been hanging out with only last week.\\n\\nIn the other reality, a six-page statement signed by Prime Suspect and\\nKen Day at AFP Headquarters at 1.20 p.m. the day before. To compound\\nmatters, Mendax began wondering if Prime Suspect may have been\\nspeaking to the AFP for as long as six months.\\n\\nThe two realities were spinning through his head, dancing around each\\nother.\\n\\nWhen Galbally arrived at the court, Mendax took him to one side to go\\nover the statement. From a damage-control perspective, it wasn\\'t a\\ncomplete disaster. Prime Suspect certainly hadn\\'t gone in hard. He\\ncould have raised a number of matters, but didn\\'t. Mendax had already\\nadmitted to most of the acts which formed the basis of his 31 charges\\nin his police interview. And he had already told the police a good\\ndeal about his adventures in Telecom\\'s telephone exchanges.\\n\\nHowever, Prime Suspect had elaborated on the Telecom break-ins in his\\nstatement. Telecom was owned by the government, meaning the court\\nwould view phreaking from their exchanges not as defrauding a company\\nbut as defrauding the Commonwealth. Had the DPP decided to lay those\\nnew charges--the Telecom charges--in February 1995 because Prime\\nSuspect had given the AFP a draft Crown witness statement back then?\\nMendax began to suspect so. Nothing seemed beyond doubt any more.\\n\\nThe immediate crisis was the committal hearing in the Melbourne\\nMagistrates Court. There was no way Boris Kayser was now going to\\ndecimate their star witness, a NorTel information systems\\nmanager. Galbally would have to run a cross-examination himself--no easy\\ntask at short notice, given the highly complex technical aspects of the\\ncase.\\n\\nInside the courtroom, as Mendax got settled, he saw Prime Suspect. He\\ngave his former friend a hard, unblinking, intense stare. Prime\\nSuspect responded with a blank wall, then he looked away. In fact,\\neven if Mendax had wanted to say something, he couldn\\'t. As a Crown\\nwitness, Prime Suspect was off-limits until the case was over.\\n\\nThe lawyers began to file into the courtroom. The DPP representative,\\nAndrea Pavleka, breezed in, momentarily lifting the tension in the\\nwindowless courtroom.\\n\\nShe had that effect on people. Tall, slender and long-legged, with a\\nbob of sandy blonde curls, booky spectacles resting on a cute button\\nnose and an infectious laugh, Pavleka didn\\'t so much walk into a\\ncourtroom as waft into it. She radiated happiness from her sunny face.\\nIt\\'s a great shame, Mendax thought, that she is on the other side.\\n\\nThe court was called into session. Prime Suspect stood in the dock and\\npleaded guilty to 26 counts of computer crimes.\\n\\nIn the course of the proceedings his barrister, Boris Kayser, told the\\ncourt that his client had cooperated with the police, including\\ntelling the AFP that the hackers had penetrated Telecom\\'s exchanges.\\nHe also said that Telecom didn\\'t believe--or didn\\'t want to\\nbelieve--that their exchanges had been compromised. When Kayser\\nprofessed loudly what a model citizen his client had been, Ken Day,\\nsitting in the public benches, quietly rolled his eyes.\\n\\nThe magistrate, John Tobin, extended Prime Suspect\\'s bail. The hacker\\nwould be sentenced at a later date.\\n\\nThat matter dealt with, the focus of the courtroom shifted to Mendax\\'s\\ncase. Geoff Chettle, for the prosecution, stood up, put the NorTel\\nmanager, who had flown in from Sydney, on the stand and asked him some\\nwarm-up questions.\\n\\nChettle could put people at ease--or rattle them--at will. Topped by a\\nminute stubble of hair, his weathered 40-something face provided a\\ngood match to his deep, gravelly voice. With quick eyes and a hard,\\nno-nonsense manner, he lacked the pretentiousness of many barristers.\\nPerhaps because he didn\\'t seem to give a fig about nineteenth century\\nprotocols, he always managed to looked out of place in a barrister\\'s\\nwig and robe. Every time he stood up, the black cape slid off his lean\\nshoulders. The barrister\\'s wig went crooked. He continually adjusted\\nit--tugging the wig back into the correct spot like some wayward\\nchild. In court, Chettle looked as if he wanted to tear off the crusty\\ntrappings of his profession and roll up his sleeves before sinking\\ninto a hearty debate. And he looked as if he would rather do it at a\\npub or the footy.\\n\\nThe NorTel manager took the stand. Chettle asked him some questions\\ndesigned to show the court the witness was credible, in support of the\\ncompany\\'s $160000 hacker-clean-up claim. His task accomplished,\\nChettle sat down.\\n\\nA little nervous, Paul Galbally stood up to his full height--more than\\nsix feet--and straightened his jacket. Dressed in a moss green suit so\\ndark it was almost black, with thin lapels and a thin, 1960s style\\ntie, he looked about as understated hip as a lawyer could--and still\\nshow his face in court.\\n\\nHalting at first, Galbally appeared unsure of himself. Perhaps he had\\nlost his nerve because of the technical issues. WMTP files. UTMP\\nfiles. PACCT audits. Network architecture. IP addresses. He had been\\nexpected to become an expert in the basics literally overnight. A\\nworried Mendax began passing him notes--questions to ask,\\nexplanations, definitions. Slowly, Galbally started working up a\\nrhythm to the cross-examination.\\n\\nDuring the questioning someone from the back of the court sidled up to\\nMendax, in the front row of seats, and handed a note over his\\nshoulder. Mendax unfolded the note, read it and then turned around to\\nsmile at the messenger. It was Electron.\\n\\nBy the time Galbally had finished, he had pulled apart much of the\\nNorTel manager\\'s evidence. As he built up a head of steam quizzing the\\nwitness, he forced the NorTel manager to admit he didn\\'t know all that\\nmuch about the alleged hacking incidents. In fact, he wasn\\'t even\\nemployed by the company when they occurred. He had largely thrown\\ntogether an affidavit based on second-hand information--and it was\\nthis affidavit which supposedly proved the hackers had cost the\\ncompany $160000. Worse, it seemed to an observer at court that the\\nNorTel manager had little Unix security technical expertise and\\nprobably would not have been able to conduct a detailed technical\\nanalysis of the incident even if he had been with the company in 1991.\\nBy the end of the defence\\'s cross-examination, it appeared that\\nGalbally knew more about Unix than the NorTel manager.\\n\\nWhen Geoff Chettle stood up to re-examine the witness, the situation\\nwas hopeless. The manager soon stood down. In Mendax\\'s view, the\\ncredibility of the NorTel Manager\\'s statement was shot.\\n\\nThe court was then adjourned until 12 May.\\n\\nAfter court, Mendax heard Geoff Chettle talking about the NorTel\\nwitness. `That guy is OFF the team,\\' he said emphatically.\\n\\nIt was a mixed victory for Mendax. His solicitor had knocked off one\\nNorTel witness, but there were more where he came from. At a full\\ntrial, the prosecution would likely fly in some real NorTel\\nfire-power, from Canada, where the 676-page security incident report\\nhad been prepared by Clark Ferguson and other members of the NorTel\\nsecurity team. Those witnesses would understand how a Unix system\\noperated, and would have first-hand knowledge of the hackers\\'\\nintrusions. It could make things much more difficult.\\n\\nWhen Mendax returned to court a week later, he was committed to stand\\ntrial in the County Court of Victoria, as expected.\\n\\nLater, Mendax asked Galbally about his options. Take the case to full\\ntrial, or plead guilty like the other two IS hackers. He wanted to\\nknow where the DPP stood on his case. Would they go in hard if he\\npleaded guilty? Had the NorTel manager disaster at the committal\\nhearing forced them to back down a little?\\n\\nPaul sighed and shook his head. The DPP were standing firm. They\\nwanted to see Mendax go to prison.\\n\\nAndrea Pavleka, the DPP\\'s sunny-faced girl who radiated happiness, was\\nbaying for blood.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne month later, on 21 July 1995, Prime Suspect arrived at the County\\nCourt for sentencing.\\n\\nRising early that morning to make sure his court suit was in order,\\nPrime Suspect had been tense. His mother cooked him a big breakfast.\\nToast, bacon and eggs the way he liked it. In fact, his favourite\\nbreakfast was an Egg McMuffin from McDonald\\'s, but he never told his\\nmother that.\\n\\nThe courtroom was already crowded. Reporters from newspapers, the wire\\nservices, a few TV channels. There were also other people, perhaps\\nwaiting for another case.\\n\\nDressed in a dark pin-stripe suit, Ken Day stood tapping on a laptop\\non the prosecution\\'s side of the courtroom. Geoff Chettle sat near\\nhim. Prime Suspect\\'s barrister, Boris Kayser, sifted through some\\npapers on the other side.\\n\\nMendax lingered at the back of the room, watching his former friend.\\nHe wanted to hear Prime Suspect\\'s sentence because, under the rules of\\nparity sentencing, Mendax\\'s own sentence would have to be similar to\\nthat of his fellow hackers. However, Prime Suspect might get some\\ndispensation for having helped the prosecution.\\n\\nA handful of Prime Suspect\\'s friends--none of them from the computer\\nunderground--trickled in. The hacker\\'s mother chatted nervously with\\nthem.\\n\\nCourt was called into session and everyone settled into their seats.\\nThe first case, it turned out, was not Prime Suspect\\'s. A tall,\\nsilver-haired man in his mid-fifties, with eyes so blue they were\\nalmost demonic, stepped into the dock. As the reporters began taking\\nnotes, Prime Suspect tried to imagine what crime the polished,\\nwell-dressed man had committed.\\n\\nChild molesting.\\n\\nThe man had not just molested children, he had molested\\nhis own son. In the parents\\' bedroom. Repeatedly. On Easter Sunday.\\nHis son was less than ten years old at the time. The whole family had\\ncollapsed. Psychologically scarred, his son had been too traumatised\\neven to give a victim impact statement.\\n\\nFor all of this, Judge Russell Lewis told the court, the man had shown\\nno remorse. Grave-faced, the judge sentenced him to a minimum prison\\nterm of five years and nine months.\\n\\nThe court clerk then called Prime Suspect\\'s case.\\n\\nAt the back of the courtroom, Mendax wondered at the strange\\nsituation. How could the criminal justice system put a child molester\\nin the same category as a hacker? Yet, here they both were being\\nsentenced side by side in the same County Court room.\\n\\nBoris Kayser had called a collection of witnesses, all of whom\\nattested to Prime Suspect\\'s difficult life. One of these, the\\nwell-regarded psychologist Tim Watson-Munro, described Prime Suspect\\'s\\ntreatments at the Austin Hospital and raised the issue of reduced\\nfree-will. He had written a report for the court.\\n\\nJudge Lewis was quick to respond to the suggestion that hacking was an\\naddiction. At one point, he wondered aloud to the courtroom whether\\nsome of Prime Suspect\\'s hacking activities were `like a shot of\\nheroin\\'.\\n\\nBefore long, Kayser had launched into his usual style of courtroom\\naddress. First, he criticised the AFP for waiting so long to charge\\nhis client.\\n\\n`This fellow should have been dealt with six to twelve months after\\nbeing apprehended. It is a bit like the US, where a man can commit a\\nmurder at twenty, have his appeal be knocked back by the Supreme Court\\nat 30 and be executed at 40--all for something he did when he was only\\ntwenty years old.\\n\\nThoroughly warmed up, Kayser observed that 20 per cent of Prime\\nSuspect\\'s life had gone by since being raided. Then he began hitting\\nhis high notes.\\n\\n`This young man received no assistance in the maturation process. He\\ndidn\\'t grow up, he drifted up.\\n\\n`His world was so horrible that he withdrew into a fantasy world. He\\nknew no other way to interact with human beings. Hacking was like a\\nphysical addiction to him.\\n\\n`If he hadn\\'t withdrawn into the cybernetic highway, what would he\\nhave done instead? Set fires? Robbed houses? Look at the name he gave\\nhimself. Prime Suspect. It has implied power--a threat. This kid\\ndidn\\'t have any power in his life other than when he sat down at a\\ncomputer.\\'\\n\\nNot only did Kayser want the judge to dismiss the idea of prison or\\ncommunity service, he was asking him to order no recorded conviction.\\n\\nThe prosecution lawyers looked at Kayser as if he was telling a good\\njoke. The AFP had spent months tracking these hackers and almost three\\nyears preparing the case against them. And now this barrister was\\nseriously suggesting that one of the key players should get off\\nvirtually scot-free, with not so much as a conviction recorded against\\nhim? It was too much.\\n\\nThe judge retired to consider the sentence. When he returned, he was\\nbrief and to the point. No prison. No community service. The recording\\nof 26 convictions. A $500 three-year good behaviour bond. Forfeiture\\nof the now ancient Apple computer seized by police in the raid. And a\\nreparation payment to the Australian National University of $2100.\\n\\nRelief passed over Prime Suspect\\'s face, pink and sweaty from the\\ntension. His friends and family smiled at each other.\\n\\nChettle then asked the judge to rule on what he called `the\\ncooperation point\\'. He wanted the judge to say that Prime Suspect\\'s\\nsentence was less than it would have been because the hacker had\\nturned Crown witness. The DPP was shoring up its position with regard\\nto its remaining target--Mendax.\\n\\nJudge Lewis told the court that the cooperation in this case made no\\ndifference. At the back of the court, Mendax felt suddenly sad. It was\\ngood news for him, but somehow it felt like a hollow victory.\\n\\nPrime Suspect has destroyed our friendship, he thought, and all for\\nnothing.\\n\\nTwo months after Prime Suspect\\'s sentencing, Trax appeared in another\\nCounty Court room to receive his sentence after pleading guilty to six\\ncounts of hacking and phreaking. Despite taking medication to keep his\\nanxiety under control while in the city, he was still very nervous in\\nthe dock.\\n\\nSince he faced the least number of charges of any of the IS hackers,\\nTrax believed he had a shot at no recorded conviction. Whether or not\\nhis lawyer could successfully argue the case was another matter.\\nBumbling through papers he could never seem to organise, Trax\\'s lawyer\\nrambled to the court, repeated the same points over and over again,\\njumping all over the place in his arguments. His voice was a\\nhalf-whispered rasp--a fact which so annoyed the judge that he sternly\\ninstructed the lawyer to speak up.\\n\\nTalking informally before court, Geoff Chettle had told Mendax that in\\nhis view there was no way Judge Mervyn Kimm would let Trax off with no\\nrecorded conviction. Judge Kimm was considered to be one tough nut to\\ncrack. If you were a bookmaker running bets on his court at a\\nsentencing hearing, the good money would be on the prosecution\\'s side.\\n\\nBut on 20 September 1995, the judge showed he couldn\\'t be predicted\\nquite so easily. Taking everything into account, including Prime\\nSuspect\\'s sentence and Trax\\'s history of mental illness, he ordered no\\nconviction be recorded against Trax. He also ordered a $500 three-year\\ngood behaviour bond.\\n\\nIn passing sentence, Judge Kimm said something startlingly insightful\\nfor a judge with little intimate knowledge of the hacker psyche. While\\nsternly stating that he did not intend to make light of the gravity of\\nthe offences, he told the court that `the factors of specific\\ndeterrence and general deterrence have little importance in the\\ndetermination of the sentence to be imposed\\'. It was perhaps the first\\ntime an Australian judge had recognised that deterrence had little\\nrelevance at the point of collision between hacking and mental\\nillness.\\n\\nTrax\\'s sentence was also a good outcome for Mendax, who on\\n29 August 1995 pleaded guilty to eight counts of computer crime, and\\nnot guilty to all the other charges. Almost a year later, on 9 May\\n1996, he pleaded guilty to an additional eleven charges, and not\\nguilty to six. The prosecution dropped all the other charges.\\n\\nMendax wanted to fight those six outstanding charges, which involved\\nANU, RMIT, NorTel and Telecom, because he felt that the law was on his\\nside in these instances. In fact, the law was fundamentally unclear\\nwhen it came to those charges. So much so that the DPP and the defence\\nagreed to take issues relating to those charges in a case stated to\\nthe Supreme Court of Victoria.\\n\\nIn a case stated, both sides ask the Supreme Court to make a ruling\\nnot on the court case itself, but on a point of law. The defence and\\nthe prosecution hammer out an agreed statement about the facts of the\\ncase and, in essence, ask the Supreme Court judges to use that\\nstatement as a sort of case study. The resulting ruling is meant to\\nclarify the finer points of the law not only for the specific case,\\nbut for similar cases which appear in future.\\n\\nPresenting a case stated to the Supreme Court is somewhat uncommon. It\\nis unusual to find a court case where both sides can agree on enough\\nof the facts, but Mendax\\'s hacking charges presented the perfect case\\nand the questions which would be put to the Victorian Supreme Court in\\nlate 1996 were crucial for all future hacking cases in Australia. What\\ndid it mean `to obtain access\\' to a computer? Did someone obtain\\naccess if he or she got in without using a password? What if he or she\\nused the username `guest\\' and the password `guest\\'?\\n\\nPerhaps the most crucial question of all was this: does a person\\n`obtain access\\' to data stored in a computer if he or she has the\\nability to view the data, but does not in fact view or even attempt to\\nview that data?\\n\\nA good example of this applied to the aggravated versions of the\\noffence of hacking: viewing commercial information. If, for example,\\nMendax logged into a NorTel computer, which contained commercially\\nsensitive information, but he didn\\'t actually read any of those files,\\nwould he be guilty of `obtaining access\\' or `obtaining access to\\ncommercial information\\'?\\n\\nThe chief judge of the County Court agreed to the case stated and sent\\nit up to the full bench of the Supreme Court. The lawyers from both\\nsides were pleased with the bench--Justices Frank Vincent, Kenneth\\nHayne and John Coldrey.\\n\\nOn 30 September 1996, Mendax arrived at the Supreme Court and found\\nall the lawyers assembled at the court--all except for his barrister.\\nPaul Galbally kept checking his watch as the prosecution lawyers began\\nunpacking their mountains of paper--the fruit of months of\\npreparation. Galbally paced the plush carpet of the Supreme Court\\nanteroom. Still no barrister.\\n\\nMendax\\'s barrister had worked tirelessly, preparing for the case\\nstated as if it was a million dollar case. Combing through legal\\nprecedents from not only Australia, the UK and the US, but from all\\nthe world\\'s Western-style democracies, he had attained a great\\nunderstanding of the law in the area of computer crime. He had finally\\narrived at that nexus of understanding between law, philosophy and\\nlinguistics which many lesser lawyers spent their entire careers\\ntrying to reach.\\n\\nBut where was he? Galbally pulled out his mobile and checked in with\\nhis office for what seemed like the fifth time in as many minutes. The\\nnews he received was bad. He was told, through second-hand sources,\\nthat the barrister had collapsed in a state of nervous exhaustion. He\\nwouldn\\'t be making it to court.\\n\\nGalbally could feel his hairs turning grey.\\n\\nWhen court opened, Galbally had to stand up and explain to three of\\nthe most senior judges in Australia why the defence would like a\\ntwo-day adjournment. A consummate professional, Geoff Chettle\\nsupported the submission. Still, it was a difficult request. Time in\\nthe Supreme Court is a scarce and valuable thing. Fortunately, the\\nadjournment was granted.\\n\\nThis gave Galbally exactly two days in which to find a barrister who\\nwas good, available and smart enough to assimilate a massive amount of\\ntechnical information in a short time. He found Andrew Tinney.\\n\\nTinney worked around the clock and by Wednesday, 2 October, he was\\nready. Once again, all the lawyers, and the hacker, gathered at the\\ncourt.\\n\\nThis time, however, it was the judges who threw a spanner into the\\nworks. They asked both sides to spend the first hour or so explaining\\nexactly why the Supreme Court should hear the case stated at all. The\\nlawyers looked at each other in surprise. What was this all about?\\n\\nAfter hearing some brief arguments from both sides, the judges retired\\nto consider their position. When they returned, Justice Hayne read a\\ndetailed judgment saying, in essence, that the judges refused to hear\\nthe case.\\n\\nAs the judge spoke, it became clear that the Supreme Court judges\\nweren\\'t just refusing to hear this case stated; they were virtually\\nrefusing to hear any case stated in future. Not for computer crimes.\\nNot for murder. Not for fraud. Not for anything. They were sending a\\nmessage to the County Court judges: don\\'t send us a case stated except\\nin exceptional circumstances.\\n\\nGeoff Chettle slumped in his chair, his hands shielding his face. Paul\\nGalbally looked stunned. Andrew Tinney looked as if he wanted to leap\\nfrom his chair shouting, `I just killed myself for the past two days\\non this case! You have to hear it!\\' Even Lesley Taylor, the quiet,\\nunflappable and inscrutable DPP solicitor who had replaced Andrea\\nPavleka on the case, looked amazed.\\n\\nThe ruling had enormous implications. Judges from the lower courts\\nwould be loath to ever send cases to the Supreme Court for\\nclarification on points of law again. Mendax had made legal history,\\nbut not in the way he had hoped.\\n\\nMendax\\'s case passed back down to the County Court.\\n\\nHe had considered taking his case to trial, but with recently\\nannounced budget cuts to Legal Aid, he knew there was little hope of\\nreceiving funding to fight the charges. The cuts were forcing the poor\\nto plead guilty, leaving justice available only for the wealthy.\\nWorse, he felt the weight of pleading guilty, not only as a sense of\\ninjustice in his own case, but for future hacking cases which would\\nfollow. Without clarity on the meaning of the law--which the judges\\nhad refused to provide--or a message from a jury in a landmark case,\\nsuch as Wandii\\'s trial, Mendax believed that hackers could expect\\nlittle justice from either the police or the courts in the future.\\n\\nOn 5 December 1996, Mendax pleaded guilty to the remaining six charges\\nand was sentenced on all counts.\\n\\nCourt Two was quiet that day. Geoff Chettle, for the prosecution,\\nwasn\\'t there. Instead, the quietly self-possessed Lesley Taylor\\nhandled the matter. Paul Galbally appeared for Mendax himself. Ken Day\\nsat, expressionless, in the front row of the public benches. He looked\\na little weary. A few rows back, Mendax\\'s mother seemed nervous.\\nElectron slipped silently into the back of the room and gave Mendax a\\ndiscreet smile.\\n\\nHis hair pulled back into a loose ponytail, Mendax blinked and rolled\\nhis eyes several times as if brought from a dark space into the\\nbright, white-walled courtroom.\\n\\nJudge Ross, a ruddy-faced and jowly man of late middle age with bushy,\\ngrey eyebrows, seated himself in his chair. At first, he was reluctant\\nto take on the case for sentencing. He thought it should be returned\\nto one of the original judges--Judge Kimm or Judge Lewis. When he\\nwalked into court that morning, he had not read the other judges\\'\\nsentences.\\n\\nLesley Taylor summarised the punishments handed down to the other two\\nhackers. The judge did not look altogether pleased. Finally, he\\nannounced he would deal with the case. `Two judges have had a crack at\\nit, why not a third one? He might do it properly.\\'\\n\\nGalbally was concerned. As the morning progressed, he became\\nincreasingly distressed; things were not going well. Judge Ross made\\nclear that he personally favoured a custodial sentence, albeit a\\nsuspended one. The only thing protecting Mendax seemed to be the\\nprinciple of parity in sentencing. Prime Suspect and Trax had\\ncommitted similar crimes to Mendax, and therefore he had to be given a\\nsimilar sentence.\\n\\nRoss `registered some surprise\\' at Judge Lewis\\'s disposition toward\\nthe sentencing of Prime Suspect. In the context of parity, he told\\nLeslie Taylor, he was at times `quite soured by some penalties\\'\\nimposed by other judges. He quizzed her for reasons why he might be\\nable to step outside parity.\\n\\nHe told the court that he had not read the telephone intercepts in the\\nlegal brief. In fact, he had `only read the summary of facts\\' and when\\nTaylor mentioned `International Subversive\\', he asked her, `What was\\nthat?\\'\\n\\nThen he asked her how to spell the word `phreak\\'.\\n\\nLater that day, after Judge Ross had read the other judges\\' sentences,\\nhe gave Mendax a sentence similar to Prime Suspect\\'s--a recorded\\nconviction on all counts, a reparation payment of $2100 to ANU and a\\nthree-year good behaviour bond.\\n\\nThere were two variations. Prime Suspect and Trax both received $500\\ngood behaviour bonds; Judge Ross ordered a $5000 bond for Mendax.\\nFurther, Judge Lewis had given Prime Suspect almost twelve months to\\npay his $2100 reparation. Judge Ross ordered Mendax to pay within\\nthree months.\\n\\nJudge Ross told Mendax, `I repeat what I said before. I thought\\ninitially that these were offences which justified a jail sentence, but\\nthe mitigatory circumstances would have converted that to a suspended\\nsentence. The sentence given to your co-offender caused me to alter that\\nview, however.\\' He was concerned, he said, `that highly intelligent\\nindividuals ought not to behave like this and I suspect it is only\\nhighly intelligent individuals who can do what you did\\'.\\n\\nThe word `addiction\\' did not appear anywhere in the sentencing\\ntranscript.\\n\\n             ',\n",
       " ' 10 -- Anthrax -- The Outsider.\\n\\n\\nThey had a gun at my head and a knife at my back; Don\\'t wind me up too tight.\\n\\n-- from `Powderworks\\' (also called The Blue Album).\\n\\nAnthrax didn\\'t like working as part of a team. He always considered\\nother people to be the weakest link in the chain.\\n\\nAlthough people were never to be trusted completely, he socialised\\nwith many hackers and phreakers and worked with a few of them now and\\nagain on particular projects. But he never formed intimate\\npartnerships with any of them. Even if a fellow hacker dobbed him in\\nto the police, the informant couldn\\'t know the full extent of his\\nactivities. The nature of his relationships was also determined, in\\npart, by his isolation. Anthrax lived in a town in rural Victoria.\\n\\nDespite the fact that he never joined a hacking partnership like The\\nRealm, Anthrax liked people, liked to talk to them for hours at a time\\non the telephone. Sometimes he received up to ten international calls\\na day from his phreaker friends overseas. He would be over at a\\nfriend\\'s house, and the friend\\'s mother would knock on the door of the\\nbedroom where the boys were hanging out, listening to new music,\\ntalking.\\n\\nThe mother would poke her head in the door, raise an eyebrow and point\\nat Anthrax. `Phone call for you. Someone from Denmark.\\' Or sometimes\\nit was Sweden. Finland. The US. Wherever. Though they didn\\'t say\\nanything, his friends\\' parents thought it all a bit strange. Not many\\nkids in country towns got international calls trailing them around\\nfrom house to house. But then not many kids were master phreakers.\\n\\nAnthrax loved the phone system and he understood its power. Many\\nphreakers thought it was enough to be able to call their friends\\naround the globe for free. Or make hacking attack phone calls without\\nbeing traced. However, real power for Anthrax lay in controlling voice\\ncommunications systems--things that moved conversations around the\\nworld. He cruised through people\\'s voice mailbox messages to piece\\ntogether a picture of what they were doing. He wanted to be able to\\nlisten into telephone conversations. And he wanted to be able to\\nreprogram the telephone system, even take it down. That was real\\npower, the kind that lots of people would notice.\\n\\nThe desire for power grew throughout Anthrax\\'s teenage years. He ached\\nto know everything, to see everything, to play with exotic systems in\\nforeign countries. He needed to know the purpose of every system, what\\nmade them tick, how they fitted together. Understanding how things\\nworked would give him control.\\n\\nHis obsession with telephony and hacking began early in life. When he\\nwas about eleven, his father had taken him to see the film War Games.\\nAll Anthrax could think of as he left the theatre was how much he\\nwanted to learn how to hack. He had already developed a fascination\\nfor computers, having received the simplest of machines, a Sinclair\\nZX81 with 1 k of memory, as a birthday present from his parents.\\nRummaging through outdoor markets, he found a few second-hand books on\\nhacking. He read Out of the Inner Circle by Bill Landreth, and Hackers\\nby Steven Levy.\\n\\nBy the time he was fourteen, Anthrax had joined a Melbourne-based\\ngroup of boys called The Force. The members swapped Commodore 64 and\\nAmiga games. They also wrote their own demos--short computer\\nprograms--and delighted in cracking the copy protections on the games\\nand then trading them with other crackers around the world. It was\\nlike an international penpal group. Anthrax liked the challenge\\nprovided by cracking the protections, but few teenagers in his town\\nshared an interest in his unusual hobby. Joining The Force introduced\\nhim to a whole new world of people who thought as he did.\\n\\nWhen Anthrax first read about phreaking he wrote to one of his American\\ncracking contacts asking for advice on how to start. His friend sent him\\na list of AT&T calling card numbers and a toll-free direct-dial number\\nwhich connected Australians with American operators. The card numbers\\nwere all expired or cancelled, but Anthrax didn\\'t care. What captured\\nhis imagination was the fact that he could call an operator all the way\\nacross the Pacific for free. Anthrax began trying to find more special\\nnumbers.\\n\\nHe would hang out at a pay phone near his house. It was a seedy\\nneighbourhood, home to the most downtrodden of all the town\\'s\\nresidents, but Anthrax would stand at the pay phone for hours most\\nevenings, oblivious to the clatter around him, hand-scanning for\\ntoll-free numbers. He dialled 0014--the prefix for the international\\ntoll-free numbers--followed by a random set of numbers. Then, as he\\ngot more serious, he approached the task more methodically. He\\nselected a range of numbers, such as 300 to 400, for the last three\\ndigits. Then he dialled over and over, increasing the number by one\\neach time he dialled. 301. 302. 303. 304. Whenever he hit a\\nfunctioning phone number, he noted it down. He never had to spend a\\ncent since all the 0014 numbers were free.\\n\\nAnthrax found some valid numbers, but many of them had modems at the\\nother end. So he decided it was time to buy a modem so he could explore\\nfurther. Too young to work legally, he lied about his age and landed an\\nafter-school job doing data entry at an escort agency. In the meantime,\\nhe spent every available moment at the pay phone, scanning and adding\\nnew numbers to his growing list of toll-free modem and operator-assisted\\nnumbers.\\n\\nThe scanning became an obsession. Often Anthrax stayed at the phone\\nuntil 10 or 11 p.m. Some nights it was 3 a.m. The pay phone had a\\nrotary dial, making the task laborious, and sometimes he would come\\nhome with blisters on the tips of his fingers.\\n\\nA month or so after he started working, he had saved enough money for\\na modem.\\n\\nHand scanning was boring, but no more so than school. Anthrax attended\\nhis state school regularly, at least until year 10. Much of that was\\ndue to his mother\\'s influence. She believed in education and in\\nbettering oneself, and she wanted to give her son the opportunities\\nshe had been denied. It was his mother, a psychiatric nurse, who\\nscrimped and saved for months to buy him his first real computer, a\\n$400 Commodore 64. And it was his mother who took out a loan to buy\\nthe more powerful Amiga a few years later in 1989. She knew the boy\\nwas very bright. He used to read her medical textbooks, and computers\\nwere the future.\\n\\nAnthrax had always done well in school, earning distinctions every\\nyear from year 7 to year 10. But not in maths. Maths bored him. Still,\\nhe had some aptitude for it. He won an award in year 6 for designing a\\npendulum device which measured the height of a building using basic\\ntrigonometry--a subject he had never studied. However, Anthrax didn\\'t\\nattend school so much after year 10. The teachers kept telling him\\nthings he already knew, or things he could learn much faster from\\nreading a book. If he liked a topic, he wandered off to the library to\\nread about it.\\n\\nThings at home became increasingly complicated around that time. His\\nfamily had struggled from the moment they arrived in Australia from\\nEngland, when Anthrax was about twelve. They struggled financially,\\nthey struggled against the roughness of a country town, and, as\\nIndians, Anthrax, his younger brother and their mother struggled\\nagainst racism.\\n\\nThe town was a violent place, filled with racial hatred and ethnic\\ntension. The ethnics had carved out corners for themselves, but\\nincursions into enemy territory were common and almost always resulted\\nin violence. It was the kind of town where people ended up in fist\\nfights over a soccer game. Not an easy place for a half-Indian,\\nhalf-British boy with a violent father.\\n\\nAnthrax\\'s father, a white Englishman, came from a farming family. One\\nof five sons, he attended an agricultural college where he met and\\nmarried the sister of an Indian student on a scholarship. Their\\nmarriage caused quite a stir, even making the local paper under the\\nheadline `Farmer Marries Indian Woman\\'. It was not a happy marriage\\nand Anthrax often wondered why his father had married an Indian.\\nPerhaps it was a way of rebelling against his dominating father.\\nPerhaps he had once been in love. Or perhaps he simply wanted someone\\nhe could dominate and control. Whatever the reason, the decision was\\nan unpopular one with Anthrax\\'s grandfather and the mixed-race family\\nwas often excluded from larger family gatherings.\\n\\nWhen Anthrax\\'s family moved to Australia, they had almost no money.\\nEventually, the father got a job as an officer at Melbourne\\'s\\nPentridge prison, where he stayed during the week. He only received a\\nmodest income, but he seemed to like his job. The mother began working\\nas a nurse. Despite their new-found financial stability, the family\\nwas not close. The father appeared to have little respect for his wife\\nand sons, and Anthrax had little respect for his father.\\n\\nAs Anthrax entered his teenage years, his father became increasingly\\nabusive. On weekends, when he was home from work, he used to hit\\nAnthrax, sometimes throwing him on the floor and kicking him. Anthrax\\ntried to avoid the physical abuse but the scrawny teenager was little\\nmatch for the beefy prison officer. Anthrax and his brother were quiet\\nboys. It seemed to be the path of least resistance with a rough father\\nin a rough town. Besides, it was hard to talk back in the painful\\nstutter both boys shared through their early teens.\\n\\nOne day, when Anthrax was fifteen, he came home to find a commotion at\\nhis house. On entering the house, Anthrax went to his parents\\'\\nbedroom. He found his mother there, and she was very upset and\\nemotionally distressed. He couldn\\'t see his father anywhere, but found\\nhim relaxing on the sofa in the lounge room, watching TV.\\n\\nDisgust consumed Anthrax and he retreated into the kitchen. When his\\nfather came in not long after to prepare some food Anthrax watched his\\nback with revulsion. Then he noticed a carving knife resting on the\\ncounter. As Anthrax reached for the knife, an ambulance worker\\nappeared in the doorway. Anthrax put the knife down and walked away.\\n\\nBut he wasn\\'t so quiet after that. He started talking back, at home and\\nat school, and that marked the beginning of the really big problems. In\\nprimary school and early high school he had been beaten up now and\\nagain. Not any more. When a fellow student hauled Anthrax up against the\\nwall of the locker shed and started shaking him and waving his fist,\\nAnthrax lost it. He saw, for a moment, his father\\'s face instead of the\\nstudent\\'s and began to throw punches in a frenzy that left his victim in\\na terrible state.\\n\\nAt home, Anthrax\\'s father learned how to bait his son. The bully\\nalways savours a morsel of resistance from the victim, which makes\\ngoing in for the kill a little more fun. Talking back gave the father\\na good excuse to get violent. Once he nearly broke his son\\'s neck.\\nAnother time it was his arm. He grabbed Anthrax and twisted his arm\\nbehind his back. There was an eerie sound of cracking cartilage, and\\nthen pain. Anthrax screamed for his father to stop. His father twisted\\nAnthrax\\'s arm harder, then pressed on his neck. His mother shrieked at\\nher husband to let go of her son. He wouldn\\'t.\\n\\n`Look at you crying,\\' his father sneered. `You disgusting animal.\\'\\n\\n`You\\'re the disgusting animal,\\' Anthrax shouted, talking back again.\\n\\nHis father threw Anthrax on the floor and began kicking him in the\\nhead, in the ribs, all over.\\n\\nAnthrax ran away. He went south to Melbourne for a week, sleeping\\nanywhere he could, in the empty night-time spaces left over by day\\nworkers gone to orderly homes. He even crashed in hospital emergency\\nrooms. If a nurse asked why he was there, he would answer politely, `I\\nreceived a phone call to meet someone here\\'. She would nod her head\\nand move on to someone else.\\n\\nEventually, when Anthrax returned home, he took up martial arts to\\nbecome strong. And he waited.\\n\\n\\nAnthrax was poking around a MILNET gateway when he stumbled on the\\ndoor to System X.* He had wanted to find this system for months,\\nbecause he had intercepted email about it which had aroused his\\ncuriosity.\\n\\nAnthrax telnetted into the gateway. A gateway binds two different\\nnetworks. It allows, for example, two computer networks which talk\\ndifferent languages to communicate. A gateway might allow someone on a\\nsystem running DECNET to login to a TCP/IP based system, like a Unix.\\nAnthrax was frustrated that he couldn\\'t seem to get past the System X\\ngateway and on to the hosts on the other side.\\n\\nUsing normal address formats for a variety of networks, he tried\\ntelling the gateway to make a connection. X.25. TCP/IP. Whatever lay\\nbeyond the gateway didn\\'t respond. Anthrax looked around until he\\nfound a sample of addresses in a help file. None of them worked, but\\nthey offered a clue as to what format an address might take.\\n\\nEach address had six digits, the first three numbers of which\\ncorresponded to telephone area codes in the Washington DC area. So he\\npicked one of the codes and started guessing the last three digits.\\n\\nHand scanning was a pain, as ever, but if he was methodical and\\npersistent, something should turn up. 111. 112. 113. 114. 115. On it\\nwent. Eventually he connected to something--a Sunos Unix system--which\\ngave him a full IP address in its login message. Now that was handy.\\nWith the full IP address, he could connect to System X again through\\nthe Internet directly--avoiding the gateway if he chose to. It\\'s\\nalways helpful in covering your tracks to have a few different routing\\noptions. Importantly, he could approach System X through more than\\njust its front door.\\n\\nAnthrax spiralled through the usual round of default usernames and\\npasswords. Nothing. This system required a more strategic attack.\\n\\nHe backed out of the login screen, escaped from the gateway and went\\nto another Internet site to have a good look at System X from a\\nhealthy distance. He `fingered\\' the site, pulling up any bit of\\ninformation System X would release to the rest of the Internet when\\nasked. He probed and prodded, looking for openings. And then he found\\none. Sendmail.\\n\\nThe version of Sendmail run by System X had a security hole Anthrax\\ncould exploit by sending himself a tiny backdoor program. To do this,\\nhe used System X\\'s mail-processing service to send a `letter\\' which\\ncontained a tiny computer program. System X would never have allowed\\nthe program to run normally, but this program worked like a letter\\nbomb. When System X opened the letter, the program jumped out and\\nstarted running. It told System X that anyone could connect to port\\n2001--to an interactive shell--of the computer without using a\\npassword.\\n\\nA port is a door to the outside world. TCP/IP computers use a standard\\nset of ports for certain services. Port 25 for mail. Port 79 for\\nFinger. Port 21 for FTP. Port 23 for Telnet. Port 513 for Rlogin. Port\\n80 for the World Wide Web. A TCP/IP based computer system has 65535\\nports but most of them go unused. Indeed, the average Unix box uses\\nonly 35, leaving the remaining 65500 ports sitting idle. Anthrax\\nsimply picked one of these sleepy ports, dusted off the cobwebs and\\nplugged in using the backdoor created by his tiny mail-borne program.\\n\\nConnecting directly to a port created some problems, because the\\nsystem wouldn\\'t recognise certain keystrokes from the port, such as\\nthe return key. For this reason, Anthrax had to create an account for\\nhimself which would let him telnet to the site and login like any\\nnormal user. To do this, he needed root privileges in order to create\\nan account and, ultimately, a permanent backdoor into the system.\\n\\nHe began hunting for vulnerabilities in System X\\'s security. There was\\nnothing obvious, but he decided to try out a bug he had successfully\\nused elsewhere. He had first learned about it on an international\\nphone conference, where he had traded information with other hackers\\nand phreakers. The security hole involved the system\\'s relatively\\nobscure load-module program. The program added features to the running\\nsystem but, more importantly, it ran as root, meaning that it had a\\nfree run on the system when it was executed. It also meant that any\\nother programs the load-module program called up also ran as root. If\\nAnthrax could get this program to run one of his own programs--a\\nlittle Trojan--he could get root on System X.\\n\\nThe load-module bug was by no means a sure thing on System X. Most\\ncommercial systems--computers run by banks or credit agencies, for\\nexample--had cleaned up the load-module bug in their Sunos computers\\nmonths before. But military systems consistently missed the bug. They\\nwere like turtles--hard on the outside, but soft and vulnerable on the\\ninside. Since the bug couldn\\'t be exploited unless a hacker was\\nalready inside a system, the military\\'s computer security officials\\ndidn\\'t seem to pay much attention to it. Anthrax had visited a large\\nnumber of military systems prior to System X, and in his experience\\nmore than 90 per cent of their Sunos computers had never fixed the\\nbug.\\n\\nWith only normal privileges, Anthrax couldn\\'t force the load-module\\nprogram to run his backdoor Trojan program. But he could trick it into\\ndoing so. The secret was in one simple keyboard character: /.\\n\\nUnix-based computer systems are a bit like the protocols of the\\ndiplomatic corps; the smallest variation can change something\\'s\\nmeaning entirely. Hackers, too, understand the implications of subtle\\nchanges.\\n\\nA Unix-based system reads the phrase:\\n\\n/bin/program\\n\\nvery differently from:\\n\\nbin program\\n\\nOne simple character--the `/\\'--makes an enormous difference. A Unix\\ncomputer reads the `/\\' as a road sign. The first phrase tells the\\ncomputer, `Follow the road to the house of the user called \"bin\" and\\nwhen you get there, go inside and fetch the file called \"program\" and\\nrun it\\'. A blank space, however, tells the computer something quite\\ndifferent. In this case, Anthrax knew it told the computer to execute\\nthe command which proceeded the space. That second phrase told the\\nmachine, `Look everywhere for a program called \"bin\" and run it\\'.\\n\\nAnthrax prepared for his attack on the load-module program by\\ninstalling his own special program, named `bin\\', into a temporary\\nstorage area on System X. If he could get System X to run his program\\nwith root privileges, he too would have procured root level access to\\nthe system. When everything was in place, Anthrax forced the system to\\nread the character `/\\' as a blank space. Then he ran the load-module\\nprogram, and watched. When System X hunted around for a program named\\n`bin\\', it quickly found Anthrax\\'s Trojan and ran it.\\n\\nThe hacker savoured the moment, but he didn\\'t pause for long. With a\\nfew swift keystrokes, he added an entry to the password file, creating\\na basic account for himself. He exited his connection to port 2001,\\ncircled around through another route, using the 0014 gateway, and\\nlogged into System X using his newly created account. It felt good\\nwalking in through the front door.\\n\\nOnce inside, Anthrax had a quick look around. The system startled him.\\nThere were only three human users. Now that was definitely odd. Most\\nsystems had hundreds of users. Even a small system might serve 30 or\\n40 people, and this was not a small system. He concluded that System X\\nwasn\\'t just some machine designed to send and receive email. It was\\noperational. It did something.\\n\\nAnthrax considered how to clean up his footsteps and secure his\\nposition. While he was hardly broadcasting his presence, someone might\\ndiscover his arrival simply by looking at who was logged in on the\\nlist of accounts in the password file. He had given his backdoor root\\naccount a bland name, but he could reasonably assume that these three\\nusers knew their system pretty well. And with only three users, it was\\nprobably the kind of system that had lots of babysitting. After all\\nthat effort, Anthrax needed a watchful nanny like a hole in the head.\\nHe worked at moving into the shadows.\\n\\nHe removed himself from the WTMP and UTMP files, which listed who had\\nbeen on-line and who was still logged in. Anthrax wasn\\'t invisible,\\nbut an admin would have to look closely at the system\\'s network\\nconnections and list of processes to find him. Next stop: the login\\nprogram.\\n\\nAnthrax couldn\\'t use his newly created front-door account for an\\nextended period--the risk of discovery was too great. If he accessed\\nthe computer repeatedly in this manner, a prying admin might\\neventually find him and delete his account. An extra account on a\\nsystem with only three users was a dead give-away. And losing access\\nto System X just as things were getting interesting was not on his\\nagenda.\\n\\nAnthrax leaned back in his chair and stretched his shoulders. His\\nhacking room was an old cloakroom, though it was barely recognisable\\nas such. It looked more like a closet--a very messy closet. The whole\\nroom was ankle-deep in scrap papers, most of them with lists of\\nnumbers on the back and front. Occasionally, Anthrax scooped up all\\nthe papers and piled them into heavy-duty garbage bags, three of which\\ncould just fit inside the room at any one time. Anthrax always knew\\nroughly where he had `filed\\' a particular set of notes. When he needed\\nit, he tipped the bag onto the floor, searched through the mound and\\nreturned to the computer. When the sea of paper reached a critical\\nmass, he jammed everything back into the garbage bag again.\\n\\nThe computer--an Amiga 500 box with a cheap Panasonic TV as the\\nmonitor--sat on a small desk next to his mother\\'s sewing machine\\ncabinet. The small bookcase under the desk\\nwas stuffed with magazines like Compute and Australian Communications,\\nalong with a few Commodore, Amiga and Unix reference manuals. There\\nwas just enough space for Anthrax\\'s old stereo and his short-wave\\nradio. When he wasn\\'t listening to his favourite show, a hacking\\nprogram broadcast from a pirate station in Ecuador, he tuned into\\nRadio Moscow or the BBC\\'s World Service.\\n\\nAnthrax considered what to do with System X. This system had aroused\\nhis curiosity and he intended to visit it frequently.\\n\\nIt was time to work on the login patch. The patch replaced the\\nsystem\\'s normal login program and had a special feature: a master\\npassword. The password was like a diplomatic passport. It would let\\nhim do anything, go anywhere. He could login as any user using the\\nmaster password. Further, when he logged in with the master password,\\nhe wouldn\\'t show up on any log files--leaving no trail. But the beauty\\nof the login patch was that, in every other way, it ran as the normal\\nlogin program. The regular computer users--all three of them--could\\nlogin as usual with their passwords and would never know Anthrax had\\nbeen in the system.\\n\\nHe thought about ways of setting up his login patch. Installing a\\npatch on System X wasn\\'t like mending a pair of jeans. He couldn\\'t\\njust slap on a swath from an old bandanna and quick-stitch it in with\\na thread of any colour. It was more like mending an expensive cashmere\\ncoat. The fabric needed to be a perfect match in colour and texture.\\nAnd because the patch required high-quality invisible mending, the\\nsize also needed to be just right.\\n\\nEvery file in a computer system has three dates: the date it was\\ncreated, the date it was last modified and the date it was last\\naccessed. The problem was that the login patch needed to have the same\\ncreation and modification dates as the original login program so that\\nit would not raise suspicions. It wasn\\'t hard to get the dates but it\\nwas difficult to paste them onto the patch. The last access date\\nwasn\\'t important as it changed whenever the program was run\\nanyway--whenever a user of the System X logged in.\\n\\nIf Anthrax ripped out the original login program and stitched his\\npatch in its place, the patch would be stamped with a new creation\\ndate. He knew there was no way to change a creation date short of\\nchanging the clock for the whole system--something which would cause\\nproblems elsewhere in System X.\\n\\nThe first thing a good system admin does when he or she suspects a\\nbreak-in is search for all files created or modified over the previous\\nfew days. One whiff of an intruder and a good admin would be all over\\nAnthrax\\'s login patch within about five minutes.\\n\\nAnthrax wrote the modification and creation dates down on a bit of\\npaper. He would need those in a moment. He also jotted down the size\\nof the login file.\\n\\nInstead of tearing out the old program and sewing in a completely new\\none, Anthrax decided to overlay his patch by copying it onto the top\\nof the old program. He uploaded his own login patch, with his master\\npassword encased inside it, but he didn\\'t install it yet. His patch\\nwas called `troj\\'--short for Trojan. He typed:\\n\\ncat<troj>/bin/login\\n\\nThe cat command told the computer: `go get the data in the file called\\n\"troj\" and put it in the file \"/bin/login\"\\'. He checked the piece of\\npaper where he had scribbled down the original file\\'s creation and\\nmodification dates, comparing them to the new patch. The creation date\\nand size matched the original. The modification date was still wrong,\\nbut he was two-thirds of the way home.\\n\\nAnthrax began to fasten down the final corner of the patch by using a\\nlittle-known feature of the command:\\n\\n/usr/5bin/date\\n\\nThen he changed the modification date of his login patch to the\\noriginal login file\\'s date.\\n\\nHe stepped back to admire his work from a distance. The newly\\ninstalled patch matched the original perfectly. Same size. Same\\ncreation date. Same modification date. With patch in place, he deleted\\nthe root account he had installed while visiting port 2001. Always\\ntake your garbage with you when you leave.\\n\\nNow for the fun bit. Snooping around. Anthrax headed off for the\\nemail, the best way to work out what a system was used for. There were\\nlots of reports from underlings to the three system users on buying\\nequipment, progress reports on a certain project, updates. What was\\nthis project?\\n\\nThen Anthrax came across a huge directory. He opened it and there,\\ncouched inside, were perhaps 100 subdirectories. He opened one of\\nthem. It was immense, containing hundreds of files. The smallest\\nsubfile had perhaps 60 computer screens\\' worth of material, all of it\\nunintelligible. Numbers, letters, control codes. Anthrax couldn\\'t make\\nhead nor tail of the files. It was as if he was staring at a group of\\nbinary files. The whole subdirectory was filled with thousands of\\npages of mush. He thought they looked like data files for some\\ndatabase.\\n\\nAs he didn\\'t have the program he needed to interpret the mush, Anthrax\\ncast around looking for a more readable directory.\\n\\nHe pried open a file and discovered it was a list. Names and phone\\nnumbers of staff at a large telecommunications company. Work phone\\nnumbers. Home numbers. Well, at least that gave him a clue as to the\\nnature of the project. Something to do with telecommunications. A\\nproject important enough that the military needed the home phone\\nnumbers of the senior people involved.\\n\\nThe next file confirmed it. Another list, a very special list. A pot\\nof gold at the end of the rainbow. The find of a career spent hacking.\\n\\nIf the US government had had any inkling what was happening at that\\nmoment, heads would have rolled. If it had known that a foreigner, and\\na follower of what mainstream American media termed an extremist\\nreligious group, had this information in his possession, the defence\\nagency would have called in every law enforcement agency it could\\nenlist.\\n\\nAs John McMahon might have said, a lot of yelling and screaming would\\nhave occurred.\\n\\nAnthrax\\'s mother had made a good home for the family, but his father\\ncontinued to disrupt it with his violence. Fun times with his friends\\nshone like bright spots amidst the decay of Anthrax\\'s family life.\\nPractical jokes were his specialty. Even as a small child, he had\\ndelighted in trickery and as he grew up, the jokes became more\\nsophisticated. Phreaking was great. It let him prank people all over\\nthe world. And pranking was cool.\\n\\nMost of the fun in pranking was sharing it with friends. Anthrax\\ncalled into a voice conference frequented by phreakers and hackers.\\nThough he never trusted others completely when it came to working on\\nprojects together, it was OK to socialise. The phreaking methods he\\nused to get onto the phone conference were his own business. Provided\\nhe was discreet in how much he said in the conference, he thought\\nthere wasn\\'t too much risk.\\n\\nHe joined the conference calls using a variety of methods. One\\nfavourite was using a multinational corporation\\'s Dialcom service.\\nCompany employees called in, gave their ID numbers, and the operator\\nput them through to wherever they wanted to go, free of charge. All\\nAnthrax needed was a valid ID number.\\n\\nSometimes it was hard work, sometimes he was lucky. The day Anthrax\\ntried the Dialcom service was a lucky day. He dialled from his\\nfavourite pay phone.\\n\\n`What is your code, sir?\\' The operator asked.\\n\\n`Yes, well, this is Mr Baker. I have a sheet with a lot of numbers\\nhere. I am new to the company. Not sure which one it is.\\' Anthrax\\nshuffled papers on top of the pay phone, near the receiver. `How many\\ndigits is it?\\'\\n\\n`Seven.\\'\\n\\nThat was helpful. Now to find seven digits. Anthrax looked across the\\nstreet at the fish and chips shop. No numbers there. Then a car\\nlicence plate caught his eye. He read off the first three digits, then\\nplucked the last four numbers from another car\\'s plate.\\n\\n`Thank you. Putting your call through, Mr Baker.\\'\\n\\nA valid number! What amazing luck. Anthrax milked that number for all\\nit was worth. Called party lines. Called phreakers\\' bridges. Access\\nfed the obsession.\\n\\nThen he gave the number to a friend in Adelaide, to call overseas. But\\nwhen that friend read off the code, the operator jumped in.\\n\\n`YOU\\'RE NOT MR BAKER!\\'\\n\\nHuh? `Yes I am. You have my code.\\'\\n\\n`You are definitely not him. I know his voice.\\'\\n\\nThe friend called Anthrax, who laughed his head off, then called into\\nDialcom and changed his code! It was a funny incident. Still, it\\nreminded him how much safer it was working by himself.\\n\\nLiving in the country was hard for a hacker and Anthrax became a\\nphreaker out of necessity, not just desire. Almost everything involved\\na long-distance call and he was always searching for ways to make\\ncalls for free. He noticed that when he called certain 008\\nnumbers--free calls--the phone would ring a few times, click, and then\\npause briefly before ringing some more. Eventually a company\\nrepresentative or answering service picked up the call. Anthrax had\\nread about diverters, devices used to forward calls automatically, in\\none of the many telecommunications magazines and manuals he was\\nconstantly reading. The click suggested the call was going through a\\ndiverter and he guessed that if he punched in the right tones at the\\nright moment, he could make the call divert away from a company\\'s\\ncustomer service agent. Furthermore, any line trace would end up at\\nthe company.\\n\\nAntrax collected some 008 numbers and fiddled with them. He discovered\\nthat if he punched another number in very quickly over the top of the\\nringing--just after the click--he could make the line divert to where\\nhe wanted it to go. He used the 008 numbers to ring phone conferences\\naround the world, where he hung out with other phreakers, particularly\\nCanadians such as members of the Toronto-based UPI or the Montreal\\ngroup, NPC, which produced a phreakers\\' manual in French. The\\nconversation on the phreaker\\'s phone conferences, or phone bridges as\\nthey are often called, inevitably turned to planning a prank. And\\nthose Canadian guys knew how to prank!\\n\\nOnce, they rang the emergency phone number in a major Canadian city.\\nUsing the Canadian incarnation of his social engineering accents,\\nAnthrax called in a `police officer in need of assistance\\'. The\\noperator wanted to know where. The phreakers had decided on the Blue\\nRibbon Ice-Cream Parlour. They always picked a spot within visual\\nrange of at least one member, so they could see what was happening.\\n\\nIn the split second of silence which followed, one of the five other\\nphreakers quietly eavesdropping on the call coughed. It was a short,\\nsharp cough. The operator darted back on the line.\\n\\n`Was that A GUN SHOT? Are you SHOT? Hello? John?\\' The operator leaned\\naway from her receiver for a moment and the phreakers heard her\\ntalking to someone else in the background. `Officer down.\\'\\n\\nThings moved so fast when pranking. What to do now?\\n\\n`Ah, yeah. Yeah.\\' It was amazing how much someone squeezing laughter\\nback down his oesophagus can sound like someone who has been shot.\\n\\n`John, talk to me. Talk to me,\\' the operator pleaded into the phone,\\ntrying to keep John alert.\\n\\n`I\\'m down. I\\'m down,\\' Anthrax strung her along.\\n\\nAnthrax disconnected the operator from the conference call. Then the\\nphreaker who lived near the ice-cream parlour announced the street had\\nbeen blocked off by police cars. They had the parlour surrounded and\\nwere anxiously searching for an injured fellow officer. It took\\nseveral hours before the police realised someone had played a mean\\ntrick on them.\\n\\nHowever, Anthrax\\'s favourite prank was Mr McKenny, the befuddled\\nsouthern American hick. Anthrax had selected the phone number at\\nrandom, but the first prank was such fun he kept coming back for more.\\nHe had been ringing Mr McKenny for years. It was always the same\\nconversation.\\n\\n`Mr McKenny? This is Peter Baker. I\\'d like my shovel back, please.\\'\\n\\n`I don\\'t have your shovel.\\'\\n\\n`Yeah, I lent it to you. Lent it to you like two years ago. I want it\\nback now.\\'\\n\\n`I never borrowed no shovel from you. Go away.\\'\\n\\n`You did. You borrowed that shovel of mine. And if you don\\'t give it\\nback I\\'m a gonna come round and get it myself. And you won\\'t like it.\\nNow, when you gonna give me that shovel back?\\'\\n\\n`Damn it! I don\\'t have your goddamn shovel!\\'\\n\\n`Give me my shovel!\\'\\n\\n`Stop calling me! I\\'ve never had your friggin\\' shovel. Let me be!\\'\\nClick.\\n\\nNine in the morning. Eight at night. Two a.m. There would be no peace\\nfor Mr McKenny until he admitted borrowing that shovel from a boy half\\nhis age and half a world away.\\n\\nSometimes Anthrax pranked closer to home. The Trading Post, a weekly\\nrag of personals from people selling and buying, served as a good\\nplace to begin. Always the innocent start, to lure them in.\\n\\n`Yes, sir, I see you advertised that you wanted to buy a bathtub.\\'\\nAnthrax put on his serious voice. `I have a bathtub for sale.\\'\\n\\n`Yeah? What sort? Do you have the measurements, and the model number?\\'\\nAnd people thought phreakers were weird.\\n\\n`Ah, no model number. But its about a metre and a half long, has feet,\\nin the shape of claws. It\\'s older style, off-white. There\\'s only one\\nproblem.\\' Anthrax paused, savouring the moment.\\n\\n`Oh? What\\'s that?\\'\\n\\n`There\\'s a body in it.\\'\\n\\nLike dropping a boulder in a peaceful pond.\\n\\n\\nThe list on System X had dial-up modem numbers, along with usernames\\nand password pairs for each address. These usernames were not words\\nlike `jsmith\\' or `jdoe\\', and the passwords would not have appeared in\\nany dictionary. 12[AZ63. K5M82L. The type of passwords and usernames\\nonly a computer would remember.\\n\\nThis, of course, made sense, since a computer picked them out in the\\nfirst place. It generated them randomly. The list wasn\\'t particularly\\nuser-friendly. It didn\\'t have headers, outlining what each item\\nrelated to. This made sense too. The list wasn\\'t meant to be read by\\nhumans.\\n\\nOccasionally, there were comments in the list. Programmers often\\ninclude a line of comment in code, which is delineated in such a way\\nthat the computer skips over the words when interpreting the commands.\\nThe comments are for other programmers examining the code. In this\\ncase, the comments were places. Fort Green. Fort Myers. Fort Ritchie.\\nDozens and dozens of forts. Almost half of them were not on the\\nmainland US. They were in places like the Philippines, Turkey,\\nGermany, Guam. Places with lots of US military presence.\\n\\nNot that these bases were any secret to the locals, or indeed to many\\nAmericans. Anthrax knew that anyone could discover a base existed\\nthrough perfectly legal means. The vast majority of people never\\nthought to look. But once they saw such a list, particularly from the\\nenvironment of a military computer\\'s bowels, it tended to drive the\\npoint home. The point being that the US military seemed to be\\neverywhere.\\n\\nAnthrax logged out of System X, killed all his connections and hung up\\nthe phone. It was time to move on. Routing through a few\\nout-of-the-way connections, he called one of the numbers on the list.\\nThe username-password combination worked. He looked around. It was as\\nhe expected. This wasn\\'t a computer. It was a telephone exchange. It\\nlooked like a NorTel DMS 100.\\n\\nHackers and phreakers usually have areas of expertise. In Australian\\nterms, Anthrax was a master of the X.25 network and a king of voice\\nmailbox systems, and others in the underground recognised him as such.\\nHe knew Trilogues better than most company technicians. He knew\\nMeridian VMB systems better than almost anyone in Australia. In the\\nphreaking community, he was also a world-class expert in Aspen VMB\\nsystems. He did not, however, have any expertise in DMS 100s.\\n\\nAnthrax quickly hunted through his hacking disks for a text file on\\nDMS 100s he had copied from an underground BBS. The pressure was on.\\nHe didn\\'t want to spend long inside the exchange, maybe only fifteen\\nor twenty minutes tops. The longer he stayed without much of a clue\\nabout how the thing operated, the greater the risk of his being\\ntraced. When he found the disk with the text file, he began sorting\\nthrough it while still on-line at the telephone exchange. The\\nphreakers\\' file showed him some basic commands, things which let him\\ngently prod the exchange for basic information without disturbing the\\nsystem too much. He didn\\'t want to do much more for fear of\\ninadvertently mutilating the system.\\n\\nAlthough he was not an authority on DMS 100s, Anthrax had an old\\nhacker friend overseas who was a real genius on NorTel equipment. He\\ngave the list to his friend. Yes, the friend confirmed it was indeed a\\nDMS 100 exchange at a US military base. It was not part of the normal\\ntelephone system, though. This exchange was part of a military phone\\nsystem.\\n\\nIn times of war, the military doesn\\'t want to be dependent on the\\ncivilian telephone system. Even in times of peace, voice\\ncommunications between military staff are more secure if they don\\'t\\ntalk on an exchange used by civilians. For this and a variety of other\\nreasons, the military have separate telephone networks, just as they\\nhave separate networks for their data communications. These networks\\noperate like a normal network and in some cases can communicate to the\\noutside world by connecting through their own exchanges to civilian\\nones.\\n\\nWhen Anthrax got the word from the expert hacker, he made up his mind\\nquickly. Up went the sniffer. System X was getting more interesting by\\nthe hour and he didn\\'t want to miss a precious minute in the information\\ngathering game when it came to this system.\\n\\nThe sniffer, a well-used program rumoured to be written by a\\nSydney-based Unix hacker called Rockstar, sat on System X under an\\ninnocuous name, silently tracking everyone who logged in and out of\\nthe system. It recorded the first 128 characters of every telnet\\nconnection that went across the ethernet network cable to which System\\nX was attached. Those 128 bytes included the username and the\\npasswords people used to log in. Sniffers were effective, but they\\nneeded time. Usually, they grew like an embryo in a healthy womb,\\nslowly but steadily.\\n\\nAnthrax resolved to return to System X in twelve hours to check on the\\nbaby.\\n\\n\\n`Why are you two watching those nigger video clips?\\'\\n\\nIt was an offensive question, but not atypical for Anthrax\\'s father.\\nHe often breezed through the house, leaving a trail of disruption in\\nhis wake.\\n\\nSoon, however, Anthrax began eroding his father\\'s authority. He\\ndiscovered his father\\'s secrets hidden on the Commodore 64 computer.\\nLetters--lots of them--to his family in England. Vicious, racist,\\nhorrid letters telling how his wife was stupid. How she had to be told\\nhow to do everything, like a typical Indian. How he regretted marrying\\nher. There were other matters too, things unpleasant to discuss.\\n\\nAnthrax confronted his father, who denied the allegations at first,\\nthen finally told Anthrax to keep his mouth shut and mind his own\\nbusiness. But Anthrax told his mother. Tensions erupted and, for a\\ntime, Anthrax\\'s parents saw a marriage counsellor.\\n\\nBut his father did not give up writing the letters. He put a password\\nprotection program on the word processor to keep his son out of his\\nbusiness. It was a futile effort. His father had chosen the wrong\\nmedium to record his indiscretions.\\n\\nAnthrax showed his mother the new letters and continued to confront\\nhis father. When the tension in the house grew, Anthrax would escape\\nwith his friends. One night they were at a nightclub when someone\\nstarted taunting Anthrax, calling him `curry muncher\\' and worse.\\n\\nThat was it. The anger which had been simmering below the surface for\\nso long exploded as Anthrax violently attacked his taunter, hitting,\\nkicking and punching him, using the tai kwon do combinations he had\\nbeen learning. There was blood and it felt good. Vengeance tasted\\nsweet.\\n\\nAfter that incident, Anthrax often lashed out violently. He was out of\\ncontrol and it sometimes scared him. However, at times he went looking\\nfor trouble. Once he tracked down a particularly seedy character who\\nhad tried to rape one of his girlfriends. Anthrax pulled a knife on\\nthe guy, but the incident had little to do with the girl. The thing\\nthat made him angry was the disrespect. This guy knew the girl was\\nwith Anthrax. The attempted rape was like spitting in his face.\\n\\nPerhaps that\\'s what appealed to Anthrax about Islam--the importance of\\nrespect. At sixteen he found Islam and it changed his life. He\\ndiscovered the Qu\\'raan in the school library while researching an\\nassignment on religion. About the same time, he began listening to a\\nlot of rap music. More than half the American rappers in his music\\ncollection were Muslim, and many sang about the Nation of Islam and\\nthe sect\\'s charismatic leader, Minister Louis Farrakhan. Their songs\\ndescribed the injustices whites inflicted on blacks. They told blacks\\nto demand respect.\\n\\nAnthrax found a magazine article about Farrakhan and began reading\\nbooks like the Autobiography of Malcolm X. Then he rang up the Nation\\nof Islam head office in Chicago and asked them to send some\\ninformation. The Final Call, the NOI newsletter, arrived one day,\\nfollowed by other literature which began appearing around Anthrax\\'s\\nhome. Under the TV guide. On the coffee table. Amid the pile of\\nnewspapers. On top of his computer. Anthrax often took time to read\\narticles aloud to his mother while she did housework.\\n\\nIn the middle of 1990, when Anthrax was in year 11, his father\\nsuggested the boy attend Catholic boarding school in Melbourne. The\\nschool was inexpensive and the family could scrape and save to pay the\\nfees. Anthrax disliked the idea, but his father insisted.\\n\\nAnthrax and his new school proved a bad match. The school thought he\\nasked too many questions, and Anthrax thought the school answered too\\nfew of them. The hypocrisy of the Catholic church riled Anthrax and\\npushed him further into the arms of NOI. How could he respect an\\ninstitution which had sanctioned slavery as a righteous and\\nprogressive method of converting people? The school and Anthrax parted\\non less than friendly terms after just one semester.\\n\\nThe Catholic school intensified a feeling of inferiority Anthrax had\\nfelt for many years. He was an outsider. The wrong colour, the wrong\\nsize, too intelligent for his school. Yet, NOI\\'s Minister Farrakhan\\ntold him that he wasn\\'t inferior at all. `I know that you have been\\ndiscriminated against because of your colour,\\' Farrakhan told Anthrax\\nfrom the tape player. `Let me tell you why. Let me tell you about the\\norigins of the white race and how they were put on this earth to do\\nevil. They have shown themselves to be nothing but an enemy of the\\nEast. Non-whites are the original people of the earth.\\'\\n\\nAnthrax found some deep veins of truth in NOI\\'s teachings. Interracial\\nmarriages don\\'t work. A white man marries a non-white woman because he\\nwants a slave, not because he loves and respects her. Islam respects\\nwomen in more meaningful ways than Western religions. Perhaps it wasn\\'t\\nthe type of respect that Western men were used to giving women, but he\\nhad seen that kind of respect in his own home and he didn\\'t think much\\nof it.\\n\\nAnthrax read the words of the Honourable Elijah Muhammad, founder of\\nNOI: `The enemy does not have to be a real devil. He could be your\\nfather, mother, brother, husband, wife or children. Many times they\\'re\\nin your own household. Today is the great time of separation of the\\nrighteous Muslim and the wicked white race.\\' Anthrax looked inside his\\nown household and saw what seemed to be a devil. A white devil.\\n\\nNOI fed Anthrax\\'s mind. He followed up the lists of literature\\nincluded in every issue of The Final Call. Books like Black Athena by\\nMartin Bernel and Deterring Democracy by Noam Chomsky had common\\nthemes of conspiracy and oppression by the haves against the\\nhave-nots. Anthrax read them all.\\n\\nThe transformation of Anthrax occurred over a period of six months. He\\ndidn\\'t talk about it much with his parents. It was a private matter.\\nBut his mother later told him his adoption of the religion didn\\'t\\nsurprise her. His great-grandfather had been a Muslim scholar and\\ncleric in India. It was fate. His conversion presented a certain sense\\nof closure, of completing the circle.\\n\\nHis interest in Islam found secular outlets. A giant black and white\\nposter of Malcolm X appeared on Anthrax\\'s bedroom wall. A huge photo\\nof Los Angeles Black Panther leader Elmer Pratt followed soon after.\\nThe photo was captioned, `A coward dies a million deaths, a brave man\\ndies but one\\'. The last bit of wall was covered in posters of hip-hop\\nbands from ceiling to floor. A traditional Indian sword adorned the\\ntop of one of the many bookcases. It complemented the growing\\ncollection of books on martial arts. A well-loved copy of The Art of\\nWar by Sun Tzu sat on the shelf next to Homer\\'s Ulysses, The Lord of\\nThe Rings, The Hobbit, a few old Dungeons and Dragons books, works of\\nmythology from India and Egypt. The shelves did not contain a single\\nwork of science fiction. Anthrax shaved his head. His mother may not\\nhave been surprised by the conversion to Islam, but the head shaving\\nwent a bit over the top.\\n\\nAnthrax pursued NOI with the same vigour with which he attacked\\nhacking. He memorised whole speeches of Farrakhan and began speaking\\nlike him, commenting casually on `those caucasian, blue-eyed devils\\'.\\nHe quoted people he had discovered through NOI. People who described\\nthe US Federal Reserve Bank as being controlled by Jews. People who\\nspoke of those hooked-nose, bagel-eating, just-crawled-out-of-a-cave\\nJews. Anthrax denied the existence of the Holocaust.\\n\\n`You\\'re shaping up to be quite a little Hitler,\\' his father told\\nAnthrax.\\n\\nHis father disliked the NOI literature showing up at the house. It\\nseemed to frighten him. Receiving blueprints in the mail for\\noverthowing governments didn\\'t sit well with the neighbours in the\\nquiet suburban street of the provincial town.\\n\\n`Watch out,\\' he warned his son. `Having these thing turn up in your\\nmailbox can be dangerous. It will probably earmark you for some sort\\nof investigation. They will follow you around.\\'\\n\\n\\nThe traffic raced. The ethernet cables attached to System X were a\\nregular speedway. People whizzed in and out of the mystery site like a\\nswarm of bees. In only twelve hours, the sniffer file topped 100 k.\\n\\nMany of the connections went from System X to the major\\ntelecommunications company. Anthrax headed in that direction.\\n\\nHe considered how to route the attack. He could go through a few\\ndiverters and other leapfrog devices to cover his trail, thus hitting\\nthe company\\'s system from a completely separate source. The advantage\\nof this route was anonymity. If the admin managed to detect his entry,\\nAnthrax would only lose access to the phone company\\'s system, not to\\nSystem X. Alternatively, if he went in to the company through the\\ngateway and System X, he risked alarms being raised at all three\\nsites. However, his sniffer showed so much traffic running on this\\nroute, he might simply disappear in the flow. The established path was\\nobviously there for a reason. One more person logging into the gateway\\nthrough System X and then into the company\\'s machine would not raise\\nsuspicions. He chose to go through System X.\\n\\nAnthrax logged into the company using a sniffed username and password.\\nTrying the load-module bug again, he got root on the system and\\ninstalled his own login patch. The company\\'s system looked far more\\nnormal than System X. A few hundred users. Lots of email, far too much\\nto read. He ran a few key word searches on all the email, trying to\\npiece together a better picture of the project being developed on\\nSystem X.\\n\\nThe company did plenty of defence work, mostly in telecommunications.\\nDifferent divisions of the company seemed to be working on different\\nsegments of the project. Anthrax searched through people\\'s home\\ndirectories, but nothing looked very interesting because he couldn\\'t\\nget a handle on the whole project. People were all developing\\ndifferent modules of the project and, without a centralised overview,\\nthe pieces didn\\'t mean much.\\n\\nHe did find a group of binary files--types of programs--but he had no\\nidea what they were for. The only real way to find out what they did\\nwas to take them for a test drive. He ran a few binaries. They didn\\'t\\nappear to do anything. He ran a few more. Again, nothing. He kept\\nrunning them, one after another. Still no results. All he received was\\nerror messages.\\n\\nThe binaries seemed to need a monitor which could display graphics.\\nThey used XII, a graphical display common on Unix systems. Anthrax\\'s\\ninexpensive home computer didn\\'t have that sort of graphical display\\noperating system. He could still run the binaries by telling System X\\nto run them on one of its local terminals, but he wouldn\\'t be able to\\nsee the output on his home computer. More importantly, it was a risky\\ncourse of action. What if someone happened to be sitting at the\\nterminal where he chose to run the binary? The game would be up.\\n\\nHe leaned away from his keyboard and stretched. Exhaustion was\\nbeginning to set in. He hadn\\'t slept in almost 48 hours. Occasionally,\\nhe had left his computer terminal to eat, though he always brought the\\nfood back to the screen. His mother popped her head in the doorway\\nonce in a while and shook her head silently. When he noticed her\\nthere, he tried to ease her concerns. `But I\\'m learning lots of\\nthings,\\' he pleaded. She was not convinced.\\n\\nHe also broke his long hacking session to pray. It was important for a\\ndevout Muslim to practice salat--to pray at least five times a day\\ndepending on the branch of Islam followed by the devotee. Islam allows\\nfollowers to group some of their prayers, so Anthrax usually grouped\\ntwo in the morning, prayed once at midday as normal, and grouped two\\nmore at night. An efficient way to meet religious obligations.\\n\\nSometimes the time just slipped away, hacking all night. When the\\nfirst hint of dawn snuck up on him, he was invariably in the middle of\\nsome exciting journey. But duty was duty, and it had to be done. So he\\npressed control S to freeze his screen, unfurled the prayer mat with\\nits built-in compass, faced Mecca, knelt down and did two sets of\\nprayers before sunrise. Ten minutes later he rolled the prayer mat up,\\nslid back into his chair, typed control Q to release the pause on his\\ncomputer and picked up where he left off.\\n\\nThis company\\'s computer system seemed to confirm what he had begun to\\nsuspect. System X was the first stage of a project, the rest of which\\nwas under development. He found a number of tables and reports in\\nSystem X\\'s files. The reports carried headers like `Traffic Analysis\\',\\n`calls in\\' and `calls out\\', `failure rate\\'. It all began to make sense\\nto Anthrax.\\n\\nSystem X called up each of the military telephone exchanges in that\\nlist. It logged in using the computer-generated name and password.\\nOnce inside, a program in System X polled the exchange for important\\nstatistics, such as the number of calls coming in and out of the base.\\nThis information was then stored on System X. Whenever someone wanted\\na report on something, for example, the military sites with the most\\nincoming calls over the past 24 hours, he or she would simply ask\\nSystem X to compile the information. All of this was done\\nautomatically.\\n\\nAnthrax had read some email suggesting that changes to an exchange,\\nsuch as adding new telephone lines on the base, had been handled\\nmanually, but this job was soon to be done automatically by System X.\\nIt made sense. The maintenance time spent by humans would be cut\\ndramatically.\\n\\nA machine which gathers statistics and services phone exchanges\\nremotely doesn\\'t sound very sexy on the face of it, until you begin to\\nconsider what you could do with something like that. You could sell it\\nto a foreign power interested in the level of activity at a certain\\nbase at a particular time. And that is just the beginning.\\n\\nYou could tap any unencrypted line going in or out of any of the 100\\nor so exchanges and listen in to sensitive military discussions. Just\\na few commands makes you a fly on the wall of a general\\'s conversation\\nto the head of a base in the Philippines. Anti-government rebels in\\nthat country might pay a pretty penny for getting intelligence on the\\nUS forces.\\n\\nAll of those options paled next to the most striking power wielded by\\na hacker who had unlimited access to System X and the 100 or so\\ntelephone exchanges. He could take down that US military voice\\ncommunications system almost overnight, and he could do it\\nautomatically. The potential for havoc creation was breathtaking. It\\nwould be a small matter for a skilled programmer to alter the\\nautomated program used by System X. Instead of using its dozen or more\\nmodems to dial all the exchanges overnight and poll them for\\nstatistics, System X could be instructed to call them overnight and\\nreprogram the exchanges.\\n\\nWhat if every time General Colin Powell picked up his phone, he was be\\nautomatically patched through to some Russian general\\'s office? He\\nwouldn\\'t be able to dial any other number from his office phone. He\\'d\\npick up his phone to dial and there would be the Russian at the other\\nend. And what if every time someone called into the general\\'s number,\\nthey ended up talking to the stationery department? What if none of the\\nphone numbers connected to their proper telephones?  No-one would be\\nable to reach one another. An important part of the US military machine\\nwould be in utter disarray. Now, what if all this happened in the first\\nfew days of a war? People trying to contact each other with vital\\ninformation wouldn\\'t be able to use the telephone exchanges reprogrammed\\nby System X.\\n\\nTHAT was power.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t like Anthrax screaming at his father until his voice turned\\nto a whisper, all for nothing. He could make people sit up and take\\nnotice with this sort of power.\\n\\nHacking a system gave him a sense of control. Getting root on a system\\nalways gave him an adrenalin rush for just that reason. It meant the\\nsystem was his, he could do whatever he wanted, he could run whatever\\nprocesses or programs he desired, he could remove other users he\\ndidn\\'t want using his system. He thought, I own the system. The word\\n`own\\' anchored the phrase which circled through his thoughts again and\\nagain when he successfully hacked a system.\\n\\nThe sense of ownership was almost passionate, rippled with streaks of\\nobsession and jealousy. At any given moment, Anthrax had a list of\\nsystems he owned and that had captured his interest for that moment.\\nAnthrax hated seeing a system administrator logging onto one of those\\nsystems. It was an invasion. It was as though Anthrax had just got\\nthis woman he had been after for some time alone in a room with the\\ndoor closed. Then, just as he was getting to know her, this other guy\\nhad barged in, sat down on the couch and started talking to her.\\n\\nIt was never enough to look at a system from a distance and know he\\ncould hack it if he wanted to. Anthrax had to actually hack the\\nsystem. He had to own it. He needed to see what was inside the system,\\nto know exactly what it was he owned.\\n\\nThe worst thing admins could do was to fiddle with system security.\\nThat made Anthrax burn with anger. If Anthrax was on-line, silently\\nobserving the admins\\' activities, he would feel a sudden urge to log\\nthem off. He wanted to punish them. Wanted them to know he was into\\ntheir system. And yet, at the same time, he didn\\'t want them to know.\\nLogging them off would draw attention to himself, but the two desires\\npulled at him from opposite directions. What Anthrax really wanted was\\nfor the admins to know he controlled their system, but for them not to\\nbe able to do anything about it. He wanted them to be helpless.\\n\\nAnthrax decided to keep undercover. But he contemplated the power of\\nhaving System X\\'s list of telephone exchange dial-ups and their\\nusername-password combinations. Normally, it would take days for a\\nsingle hacker with his lone modem to have much impact on the US\\nmilitary\\'s communications network. Sure, he could take down a few\\nexchanges before the military wised up and started protecting\\nthemselves. It was like hacking a military computer. You could take\\nout a machine here, a system there. But the essence of the power of\\nSystem X was being able to use its own resources to orchestrate\\nwidespread pandemonium quickly and quietly.\\n\\nAnthrax defines power as the potential for real world impact. At that\\nmoment of discovery and realisation, the real world impact of hacking\\nSystem X looked good. The telecommunications company computer seemed\\nlike a good place to hang up a sniffer, so he plugged one into the\\nmachine and decided to return in a little while. Then he logged out\\nand went to bed.\\n\\nWhen he revisited the sniffer a day or so later, Anthrax received a\\nrude shock. Scrolling through the sniffer file, he did a double take\\non one of the entries. Someone had logged into the company\\'s system\\nusing his special login patch password.\\n\\nHe tried to stay calm. He thought hard. When was the last time he had\\nlogged into the system using that special password? Could his sniffer\\nhave logged himself on an earlier hacking session? It did happen\\noccasionally. Hackers sometimes gave themselves quite a fright. In the\\nseamless days and nights of hacking dozens of systems, it was easy to\\nforget the last time you logged into a particular system using the\\nspecial password. The more he thought, the more he was absolutely\\nsure. He hadn\\'t logged into the system again.\\n\\nWhich left the obvious question. Who had?\\n\\n\\nSometimes Anthrax pranked, sometimes he punished. Punishment could be\\nsevere or mild. Generally it was severe. And unlike pranking, it was\\nnot done randomly.\\n\\nDifferent things set him off. The librarian, for example. In early\\n1993 Anthrax had enrolled in Asia-Pacific and Business Studies at a\\nuniversity in a nearby regional city. Ever since he showed up on the\\ncampus, he had been hassled by a student who worked part-time at the\\nuniversity library. On more than one occasion, Anthrax had been\\nreading at a library table when a security guard came up and asked to\\nsearch his bags. And when Anthrax looked over his shoulder to the\\ncheck-out desk, that librarian was always there, the one with the bad\\nattitude smeared across his face.\\n\\nThe harassment became so noticeable, Anthrax\\'s friends began\\ncommenting on it. His bag would be hand-searched when he left the\\nlibrary, while other students walked through the electronic security\\nboom gate unbothered. When he returned a book one day late, the\\nlibrarian--that librarian--insisted he pay all sorts of fines.\\nAnthrax\\'s pleas of being a poor student fell on deaf ears. By the time\\nexam period rolled around at the end of term, Anthrax decided to\\npunish the librarian by taking down the library\\'s entire computer\\nsystem.\\n\\nLogging in to the library computer via modem from home, Anthrax\\nquickly gained root privileges. The system had security holes a mile\\nwide. Then, with one simple command, he deleted every file in the\\ncomputer. He knew the system would be backed up somewhere, but it\\nwould take a day or two to get the system up and running again. In the\\nmeantime, every loan or book search had to be conducted manually.\\n\\nDuring Anthrax\\'s first year at university, even small incidents\\nprovoked punishment. Cutting him off while he was driving, or swearing\\nat him on the road, fit the bill. Anthrax would memorise the licence\\nplate of the offending driver, then social engineer the driver\\'s\\npersonal details. Usually he called the police to report what appeared\\nto be a stolen car and then provided the licence plate number. Shortly\\nafter, Anthrax tuned into to his police scanner, where he picked up\\nthe driver\\'s name and address as it was read over the airways to the\\ninvestigating police car. Anthrax wrote it all down.\\n\\nThen began the process of punishment. Posing as the driver, Anthrax rang\\nthe driver\\'s electricity company to arrange a power disconnection. The\\nnext morning the driver might return home to find his electricity cut\\noff. The day after, his gas might be disconnected.  Then his water. Then\\nhis phone.\\n\\nSome people warranted special punishment--people such as Bill. Anthrax\\ncame across Bill on the Swedish Party Line, an English-speaking\\ntelephone conference. For a time, Anthrax was a regular fixture on the\\nline, having attempted to call it by phreaking more than 2000 times\\nover just a few months. Of course, not all those attempts were\\nsuccessful, but he managed to get through at least half the time. It\\nrequired quite an effort to keep a presence on the party line, since\\nit automatically cut people off after only ten minutes. Anthrax made\\nfriends with the operators, who sometimes let him stay on-line a while\\nlonger.\\n\\nBill, a Swedish Party Line junkie, had recently been released from\\nprison, where he had served time for beating up a Vietnamese boy at a\\nrailway station. He had a bad attitude and he often greeted the party\\nline by saying, `Are there any coons on the line today?\\' His attitude\\nto women wasn\\'t much better. He relentlessly hit on the women who\\nfrequented the line. One day, he made a mistake. He gave out his phone\\nnumber to a girl he was trying to pick up. The operator copied it down\\nand when her friend Anthrax came on later that day, she passed it on\\nto him.\\n\\nAnthrax spent a few weeks social engineering various people, including\\nutilities and relatives whose telephone numbers appeared on Bill\\'s\\nphone accounts, to piece together the details of his life. Bill was a\\nrough old ex-con who owned a budgie and was dying of cancer. Anthrax\\nphoned Bill in the hospital and proceeded to tell him all sorts of\\npersonal details about himself, the kind of details which upset a\\nperson.\\n\\nNot long after, Anthrax heard that Bill had died. The hacker felt as\\nthough he had perhaps gone a bit too far.\\n\\n\\nThe tension at home had eased a little by the time Anthrax left to\\nattend university. But when he returned home during holidays he found\\nhis father even more unbearable. More and more, Anthrax rebelled\\nagainst his father\\'s sniping comments and violence. Eventually, he\\nvowed that the next time his father tried to break his arm he would\\nfight back. And he did.\\n\\nOne day Anthrax\\'s father began making bitter fun of his younger son\\'s\\nstutter. Brimming with biting sarcasm, the father mimicked Anthrax\\'s\\nbrother.\\n\\n`Why are you doing that?\\' Anthrax yelled. The bait had worked once\\nagain.\\n\\nIt was as though he became possessed with a spirit not his own. He\\nyelled at his father, and put a fist into the wall. His father grabbed\\na chair and thrust it forward to keep Anthrax at bay, then reached\\nback for the phone. Said he was calling the police. Anthrax ripped the\\nphone from the wall. He pursued his father through the house, smashing\\nfurniture. Amid the crashing violence of the fight, Anthrax suddenly\\nfelt a flash of fear for his mother\\'s clock--a much loved, delicate\\nfamily heirloom. He gently picked it up and placed it out of harm\\'s\\nway. Then he heaved the stereo into the air and threw it at his\\nfather. The stereo cabinet followed in its wake. Wardrobes toppled\\nwith a crash across the floor.\\n\\nWhen his father fled the house, Anthrax got a hold of himself and\\nbegan to look around. The place was a disaster area. All those things\\nso tenderly gathered and carefully treasured by his mother, the things\\nshe had used to build her life in a foreign land of white people\\nspeaking an alien tongue, lay in fragments scattered around the house.\\n\\nAnthrax felt wretched. His mother was distraught at the destruction\\nand he was badly shaken by how much it upset her. He promised to try\\nand control his temper from that moment on. It proved to be a constant\\nbattle. Mostly he would win, but not always. The battle still simmered\\nbelow the surface.\\n\\nSometimes it boiled over.\\n\\n\\nAnthrax considered the possibilities of who else would be using his\\nlogin patch. It could be another hacker, perhaps someone who was\\nrunning another sniffer that logged Anthrax\\'s previous login. But it\\nwas more likely to be a security admin. Meaning he had been found out.\\nMeaning that he might be being traced even as he leap-frogged through\\nSystem X to the telecommunications company\\'s computer.\\n\\nAnthrax made his way to the system admin\\'s mailboxes. If the game was\\nup, chances were something in the mailbox would give it away.\\n\\nThere it was. The evidence. They were onto him all right, and they\\nhadn\\'t wasted any time. The admins had mailed CERT, the Computer\\nEmergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon University, reporting a\\nsecurity breach. CERT, the nemesis of every Internet hacker, was bound\\nto complicate matters. Law enforcement would no doubt be called in\\nnow.\\n\\nIt was time to get out of this system, but not before leaving in a\\nblaze of glory. A prank left as a small present.\\n\\nCERT had written back to the admins acknowledging the incident and\\nproviding a case number. Posing as one of the admins, Anthrax drafted\\na letter to CERT. To make the thing look official, he added the case\\nnumber `for reference\\'. The letter went something like this:\\n\\n`In regard to incident no. XXXXX, reported on this date, we have since\\ncarried out some additional investigations on the matter. We have\\ndiscovered the security incident was caused by a disgruntled employee\\nwho was fired for alcoholism and decided to retaliate against the\\ncompany in this manner.\\n\\n`We have long had a problem with alcohol and drug abuse due to the\\nstressful nature of the company environment. No further investigation\\nis necessary.\\'\\n\\nAt his computer terminal, Anthrax smiled. How embarrassing was that\\ngoing to be? Try scraping that mud off. He felt very pleased with\\nhimself.\\n\\nAnthrax then tidied up his things in the company\\'s computer, deleted\\nthe sniffer and moved out.\\n\\nThings began to move quickly after that. He logged into System X later\\nto check the sniffer records, only to find that someone had used his\\nlogin patch password on that system as well. He became very nervous.\\nIt was one thing goofing around with a commercial site, and quite\\nanother being tracked from a military computer.\\n\\nA new process had been added to System X, which Anthrax recognised. It\\nwas called `-u\\'. He didn\\'t know what it did, but he had seen it before\\non military systems. About 24 hours after it appeared, he found\\nhimself locked out of the system. He had tried killing off the -u\\nprocess before. It disappeared for a split-second and reappeared. Once\\nit was in place, there was no way to destroy it.\\n\\nAnthrax also unearthed some alarming email. The admin at a site\\nupstream from both System X and the company\\'s system had been sent a\\nwarning letter: `We think there has been a security incident at your\\nsite\\'. The circle was closing in on him. It was definitely time to get\\nthe hell out. He packed up his things in a hurry. Killed off the\\nremaining sniffer. Moved his files. Removed the login patch. And\\ndeparted with considerable alacrity.\\n\\nAfter he cut his connection, Anthrax sat wondering about the admins.\\nIf they knew he was into their systems, why did they leave the\\nsniffers up and running? He could understand leaving the login patch.\\nMaybe they wanted to track his movements, determine his motives, or\\ntrace his connection. Killing the patch would have simply locked him\\nout of the only door the admins could watch. They wouldn\\'t know if he\\nhad other backdoors into their system. But the sniffer? It didn\\'t make\\nany sense.\\n\\nIt was possible that they simply hadn\\'t seen the sniffer. Leaving it\\nthere had been an oversight. But it was almost too glaring an error to\\nbe a real possibility. If it was an error, it implied the admins\\nweren\\'t actually monitoring the connections in and out of their\\nsystems. If they had been watching the connections, they would\\nprobably have seen the sniffer. But if they weren\\'t monitoring the\\nconnections, how on earth did they find out his special password for\\nthe login patch? Like all passwords on the system, that one was\\nencrypted. There were only two ways to get that password. Monitor the\\nconnection and sniff it, or break the encryption with a brute-force\\nattack.\\n\\nBreaking the encryption would probably have taken millions of dollars\\nof computer time. He could pretty well rule that option out. That left\\nsniffing it, which would have alerted them to his own sniffer. Surely\\nthey wouldn\\'t have left his sniffer running on purpose. They must have\\nknown he would learn they were watching him through his sniffer. The\\nwhole thing was bizarre.\\n\\nAnthrax thought about the admins who were chasing him. Thought about\\ntheir moves, their strategies. Wondered why. It was one of the\\nunsolved mysteries a hacker often faced--an unpleasant side of\\nhacking. Missing the answers to certain questions, the satisfaction of\\na certain curiosity. Never being able to look over the fence at the\\nother side.\\n\\n\\n             ',\n",
       " ' 11 -- The Prisoner\\'s Dilemma.\\n\\n\\nHarrisburg Oh Harrisburg; The plant is melting down; The people out in Harrisbug; Are getting out of town; And when this stuff gets in; You cannot get it out .\\n\\n-- from `Harrisburg\\', Red Sails in the Sunset.\\n\\nAnthrax thought he would never get caught. But in some strange way, he\\nalso wanted to get caught. When he thought about being busted, he\\nfound himself filled with a strange emotion--impatience. Bring on the\\nimpending doom and be done with it. Or perhaps it was frustration at\\nhow inept his opponents seemed to be. They kept losing his trail and\\nhe was impatient with their incompetence. It was more fun outwitting a\\nworthy opponent.\\n\\nPerhaps he didn\\'t really want to be caught so much as tracked. Anthrax\\nliked the idea of the police tracking him, of the system\\nadministrators pursuing him. He liked to follow the trail of their\\ninvestigations through other people\\'s mail. He especially liked being\\non-line, watching them trying to figure out where he was coming from.\\nHe would cleverly take control of their computers in ways they\\ncouldn\\'t see. He watched every character they typed, every spelling\\nerror, every mistyped command, each twist and turn taken in the vain\\nhope of catching him.\\n\\nHe hadn\\'t been caught back in early 1991, when it seemed everyone was\\nafter him. In fact Anthrax nearly gave up hacking and phreaking\\ncompletely in that year after what he later called `The Fear of God\\'\\nspeech.\\n\\nLate at night, on a university computer system, he bumped into another\\nhacker. It wasn\\'t an entirely uncommon experience. Once in a while,\\nhackers recognised another of their kind. Strange connections to\\nstrange places in the middle of the night. Inconsistencies in process\\nnames and sizes. The clues were visible for those who knew how to find\\nthem.\\n\\nThe two hackers danced around each other, trying to determine who the\\nother was without giving away too much information. Finally the\\nmystery hacker asked Anthrax, `Are you a disease which affects sheep?\\'\\n\\nAnthrax typed the simple answer back. `Yes.\\'\\n\\nThe other hacker revealed himself as Prime Suspect, one of the\\nInternational Subversives. Anthrax recognised the name. He had seen\\nPrime Suspect around on the BBSes, had read his postings. Before\\nAnthrax could get started on a friendly chat, the IS hacker jumped in\\nwith an urgent warning.\\n\\nHe had unearthed emails showing the Feds were closing in on Anthrax.\\nThe mail, obtained from system admins at Miden Pacific, described the\\nsystems Anthrax had been visiting. It showed the phone connections he\\nhad been using to get to them, some of which Telecom had traced back\\nto his phone. One of the admins had written, `We\\'re on to him. I feel\\nreally bad. He\\'s seventeen years old and they are going to bust him\\nand ruin his life.\\' Anthrax felt a cold chill run down his spine.\\n\\nPrime Suspect continued with the story. When he first came across the\\nemail, he thought it referred to himself. The two hackers were the\\nsame age and had evidently been breaking into the same systems. Prime\\nSuspect had freaked out over the mail. He took it back to the other\\ntwo IS hackers, and they talked it through. Most of the description\\nfitted, but a few of the details didn\\'t seem to make sense. Prime\\nSuspect wasn\\'t calling from a country exchange. The more they worked\\nit through, the clearer it became that the email must have been\\nreferring to someone else. They ran through the list of other options\\nand Anthrax\\'s name came up as a possibility. The IS hackers had all\\nseen him around a few systems and BBSes. Trax had even spoken to him\\nonce on a conference call with another phreaker. They pieced together\\nwhat they knew of him and the picture fitted. The AFP were onto\\nAnthrax and they seemed to know a lot about him. They had traced his\\ntelephone connection back to his house. They knew his age, which\\nimplied they knew his name. The phone bills were in his parents\\'\\nnames, so there may have been some personal surveillance of him. The\\nFeds were so close they were all but treading on his heels. The IS\\nhackers had been keeping an eye out for him, to warn him, but this was\\nthe first time they had found him.\\n\\nAnthrax thanked Prime Suspect and got out of the system. He sat frozen\\nin the night stillness. It was one thing to contemplate getting caught,\\nto carry mixed emotions on the hypothetical situation. It was another to\\nhave the real prospect staring you in the face. In the morning, he\\ngathered up all his hacking papers, notes, manuals--everything. Three\\ntrunks\\' worth of material. He carried it all to the back garden, lit a\\nbonfire and watched it burn. He vowed to give up hacking forever.\\n\\nAnd he did give it up, for a time. But a few months later he somehow\\nfound himself back in front of his computer screen, with his modem\\npurring. It was so tempting, so hard to let go. The police had never\\nshown up. Months had come and gone, still nothing. Prime Suspect must\\nhave been wrong. Perhaps the AFP were after another hacker entirely.\\n\\nThen, in October 1991, the AFP busted Prime Suspect, Mendax and Trax.\\nBut Anthrax continued to hack, mostly on his own as usual, for another\\ntwo years. He reminded himself that the IS hackers worked in a team.\\nIf the police hadn\\'t nailed him when they busted the others, surely\\nthey would never find him now. Further, he had become more skilled as\\na hacker, better at covering his tracks, less likely to draw attention\\nto himself. He had other rationalisations too. The town where he lived\\nwas so far away, the police would never bother travelling all the way\\ninto the bush. The elusive Anthrax would remain at large forever, the\\nunvanquished Ned Kelly of the computer underground.\\n\\n\\nMundane matters were on Anthrax\\'s mind on the morning of 14 July 1994.\\nThe removalists were due to arrive to take things from the half-empty\\napartment he had shared with another student. His room-mate had\\nalready departed and the place was a clutter of boxes stuffed with\\nclothes, tapes and books.\\n\\nAnthrax sat in bed half-asleep, half-watching the `Today\\' show when he\\nheard the sound of a large vehicle pulling up outside. He looked out\\nthe window expecting to see the removalists. What he saw instead was\\nat least four men in casual clothes running toward the house.\\n\\nThey were a little too enthusiastic for removalists and they split up\\nbefore getting to the door, with two men forking off toward opposite\\nsides of the building. One headed for the car port. Another dove\\naround the other side of the building. A third banged on the front\\ndoor. Anthrax shook himself awake.\\n\\nThe short, stocky guy at the front door was a worry. He had puffy,\\nlongish hair and was wearing a sweatshirt and acid-wash jeans so tight\\nyou could count the change in his back pocket. Bad ideas raced through\\nAnthrax\\'s head. It looked like a home invasion. Thugs were going to\\nbreak into his home, tie him up and terrorise him before stealing all\\nhis valuables.\\n\\n`Open up. Open up,\\' the stocky one shouted, flashing a police badge.\\n\\nStunned, and still uncomprehending, Anthrax opened the door. `Do you\\nknow who WE are?\\' the stocky one asked him.\\n\\nAnthrax looked confused. No. Not sure.\\n\\n`The Australian Federal Police.\\' The cop proceeded to read out the\\nsearch warrant.\\n\\nWhat happened from this point forward is a matter of some debate. What\\nis fact is that the events of the raid and what\\nfollowed formed the basis of a formal complaint by Anthrax to the\\nOffice of the Ombudsman and an internal investigation within the AFP.\\nThe following is simply Anthrax\\'s account of how it happened.\\n\\nThe stocky one barked at Anthrax, `Where\\'s your computer?\\'\\n\\n`What computer?\\' Anthrax looked blankly at the officer. He didn\\'t have\\na computer at his apartment. He used the uni\\'s machines or friend\\'s\\ncomputers.\\n\\n`Your computer. Where is it? Which one of your friends has it?\\'\\n\\n`No-one has it. I don\\'t own one.\\'\\n\\n`Well, when you decide to tell us where it is, you let us know.\\'\\n\\nYeah. Right. If Anthrax did have a hidden computer at uni, revealing\\nits location wasn\\'t top of the must-do list.\\n\\nThe police pawed through his personal letters, quizzed Anthrax about\\nthem. Who wrote this letter? Is he in the computer underground? What\\'s\\nhis address?\\n\\nAnthrax said `no comment\\' more times than he could count. He saw a few\\npolice moving into his bedroom and decided it was time to watch them\\nclosely, make sure nothing was planted. He stood up to follow them in\\nand observe the search when one of the cops stopped him. Anthrax told\\nthem he wanted a lawyer. One of the police looked on with disapproval.\\n\\n`You must be guilty,\\' he told Anthrax. `Only guilty people ask for\\nlawyers. And here I was feeling sorry for you.\\'\\n\\nThen one of the other officers dropped the bomb. `You know,\\' he began\\ncasually, `we\\'re also raiding your parents\\' house ...\\'\\n\\nAnthrax freaked out. His mum would be hysterical. He asked to call his\\nmother on his mobile, the only phone then working in the apartment.\\nThe police refused to let him touch his mobile. Then he asked to call\\nher from the pay phone across the street. The police refused again.\\nOne of the officers, a tall, lanky cop, recognised a leverage point if\\never he saw one. He spread the guilt on thick.\\n\\n`Your poor sick mum. How could you do this to your poor sick mum?\\nWe\\'re going to have to take her to Melbourne for questioning, maybe\\neven to charge her, arrest her, take her to jail. You make me sick. I\\nfeel sorry for a mother having a son like you who is going to cause\\nher all this trouble.\\'\\n\\nFrom that moment on, the tall officer took every opportunity to talk\\nabout Anthrax\\'s `poor sick mum\\'. He wouldn\\'t let up. Not that he\\nprobably knew the first thing about scleroderma, the creeping fatal\\ndisease which affected her. Anthrax often thought about the pain his\\nmother was in as the disease worked its way from her extremities to\\nher internal organs. Scleroderma toughened the skin on the fingers and\\nfeet, but made them overly sensitive, particularly to changes in\\nweather. It typically affected women native to hot climates who moved\\nto colder environments.\\n\\nAnthrax\\'s mobile rang. His mother. It had to be. The police wouldn\\'t\\nlet him answer it.\\n\\nThe tall officer picked up the call, then turned to the stocky cop and\\nsaid in a mocking Indian accent, `It is some woman with an Indian\\naccent\\'. Anthrax felt like jumping out of his chair and grabbing the\\nphone. He felt like doing some other things too, things that would\\nhave undoubtedly landed him in prison then and there.\\n\\nThe stocky cop nodded to the tall one, who handed the mobile to\\nAnthrax.\\n\\nAt first, he couldn\\'t make sense of what his mother was saying. She\\nwas a terrified mess. Anthrax tried to calm her down. Then she tried\\nto comfort him.\\n\\n`Don\\'t worry. It will be all right,\\' she said it, over and over. No\\nmatter what Anthrax said, she repeated that phrase, like a chant. In\\ntrying to console him, she was actually calming herself. Anthrax\\nlistened to her trying to impose order on the chaos around her. He\\ncould hear noises in the background and he guessed it was the police\\nrummaging through her home. Suddenly, she said she had to go and hung\\nup.\\n\\nAnthrax handed the phone back to the police and sat with his head in\\nhis hands. What a wretched situation. He couldn\\'t believe this was\\nhappening to him. How could the police seriously consider taking his\\nmother to Melbourne for questioning? True, he phreaked from her home\\noffice phone, but she had no idea how to hack or phreak. As for\\ncharging his mother, that would just about kill her. In her mental and\\nphysical condition, she would simply collapse, maybe never to get up\\nagain.\\n\\nHe didn\\'t have many options. One of the cops was sealing up his mobile\\nphone in a clear plastic bag and labelling it. It was physically\\nimpossible for him to call a lawyer, since the police wouldn\\'t let him\\nuse the mobile or go to a pay phone. They harangued him about coming\\nto Melbourne for a police interview.\\n\\n`It is your best interest to cooperate,\\' one of the cops told him. `It\\nwould be in your best interest to come with us now.\\'\\n\\nAnthrax pondered that line for a moment, considered how ludicrous it\\nsounded coming from a cop. Such a bald-faced lie told so\\nmatter-of-factly. It would have been humorous if the situation with\\nhis mother hadn\\'t been so awful. He agreed to an interview with the\\npolice, but it would have to be done on another day.\\n\\nThe cops wanted to search his car. Anthrax didn\\'t like it, but there\\nwas nothing incriminating in the car anyway. As he walked outside in\\nthe winter morning, one of the cops looked down at Anthrax\\'s feet,\\nwhich were bare in accordance with the Muslim custom of removing shoes\\nin the house. The cop asked if he was cold.\\n\\nThe other cop answered for Anthrax. `No. The fungus keeps them warm.\\'\\n\\nAnthrax swallowed his anger. He was used to racism, and plenty of it,\\nespecially from cops. But this was over the top.\\n\\nIn the town where he attended uni, everyone thought he was Aboriginal.\\nThere were only two races in that country town--white and Aboriginal.\\nIndian, Pakistani, Malay, Burmese, Sri Lankan--it didn\\'t matter. They\\nwere all Aboriginal, and were treated accordingly.\\n\\nOnce when he was talking on the pay phone across from his house, the\\npolice pulled up and asked him what he was doing there. Talking on the\\nphone, he told them. It was pretty obvious. They asked for\\nidentification, made him empty his pockets, which contained his small\\nmobile phone. They told him his mobile must be stolen, took it from\\nhim and ran a check on the serial number. Fifteen minutes and many\\nmore accusations later, they finally let him go with the flimsiest of\\napologies. `Well, you understand,\\' one cop said. `We don\\'t see many of\\nyour type around here.\\'\\n\\nYeah. Anthrax understood. It looked pretty suspicious, a dark-skinned\\nboy using a public telephone. Very suss indeed.\\n\\nIn fact, Anthrax had the last laugh. He had been on a phreaked call to\\nCanada at the time and he hadn\\'t bothered to hang up when the cops\\narrived. Just told the other phreakers to hang on. After the police\\nleft, he picked up the conversation where he left off.\\n\\nIncidents like that taught him that sometimes the better path was to\\ntoy with the cops. Let them play their little games. Pretend to be\\nmanipulated by them. Laugh at them silently and give them nothing. So\\nhe appeared to ignore the fungus comment and led the cops to his car.\\nThey found nothing.\\n\\nWhen the police finally packed up to leave, one of them handed Anthrax\\na business card with the AFP\\'s phone number.\\n\\n`Call us to arrange an interview time,\\' he said.\\n\\n`Sure,\\' Anthrax replied as he shut the door.\\n\\n\\nAnthrax keep putting the police off. Every time they called hassling\\nhim for an interview, he said he was busy. But when they began ringing\\nup his mum, he found himself in a quandary. They were threatening and\\nyet reassuring to his mother all at the same time and spoke politely\\nto her, even apologetically.\\n\\n`As bad as it sounds,\\' one of them said, `we\\'re going to have to\\ncharge you with things Anthrax has done, hacking, phreaking, etc. if\\nhe doesn\\'t cooperate with us. We know it sounds funny, but we\\'re\\nwithin our rights to do that. In fact that is what the law dictates\\nbecause the phone is in your name.\\'\\n\\nHe followed this with the well-worn `it\\'s in your son\\'s best interest\\nto cooperate\\' line, delivered with cooing persuasion.\\n\\nAnthrax wondered why there was no mention of charging his father,\\nwhose name appeared on the house\\'s main telephone number. That line\\nalso carried some illegal calls.\\n\\nHis mother worried. She asked her son to cooperate with the police.\\nAnthrax felt he had to protect his mother and finally agreed to a\\npolice interview after his uni exams. The only reason he did so was\\nbecause of the police threat to charge his mother. He was sure that if\\nthey dragged his mother through court, her health would deteriorate\\nand lead to an early death.\\n\\nAnthrax\\'s father picked him up from uni on a fine November day and\\ndrove down to Melbourne. His mother had insisted that he attend the\\ninterview, since he knew all about the law and police. Anthrax didn\\'t\\nmind having him along: he figured a witness might prevent any use of\\npolice muscle.\\n\\nDuring the ride to the city, Anthrax talked about how he would handle\\nthe interview. The good news was that the AFP had said they wanted to\\ninterview him about his phreaking, not his hacking. He went to the\\ninterview understanding they would only be discussing his `recent\\nstuff\\'--the phreaking. He had two possible approaches to the\\ninterview. He could come clean and admit everything, as his first\\nlawyer had advised. Or he could pretend to cooperate and be evasive,\\nwhich was what his instincts told him to do.\\n\\nHis father jumped all over the second option. `You have to cooperate\\nfully. They will know if you are lying. They are trained to pick out\\nlies. Tell them everything and they will go easier on you.\\' Law and\\norder all the way.\\n\\n`Who do they think they are anyway? The pigs.\\' Anthrax looked away,\\ndisgusted at the thought of police harassing people like his mother.\\n\\n`Don\\'t call them pigs,\\' his father snapped. `They are police officers.\\nIf you are ever in trouble, they are the first people you are ever\\ngoing to call.\\'\\n\\n`Oh yeah. What kind of trouble am I going to be in that the first\\npeople I call are the AFP?\\' Anthrax replied.\\n\\nAnthrax would put up with his father coming along so long as he kept\\nhis mouth shut during the interview. He certainly wasn\\'t there for\\npersonal support. They had a distant relationship at best. When his\\nfather began working in the town where Anthrax now lived and studied,\\nhis mother had tried to patch things between them. She suggested his\\nfather take Anthrax out for dinner once a week, to smooth things over.\\nDevelop a relationship. They had dinner a handful of times and Anthrax\\nlistened to his father\\'s lectures. Admit you were wrong. Cooperate\\nwith the police. Get your life together. Own up to it all. Grow up. Be\\nresponsible. Stop being so useless. Stop being so stupid.\\n\\nThe lectures were a bit rich, Anthrax thought, considering that his\\nfather had benefited from Anthrax\\'s hacking skills. When he discovered\\nAnthrax had got into a huge news clipping database, he asked the boy\\nto pull up every article containing the word `prison\\'. Then he had him\\nsearch for articles on discipline. The searches should have cost a\\nfortune, probably thousands of dollars. But his father didn\\'t pay a\\ncent, thanks to Anthrax. And he didn\\'t spend much time lecturing\\nAnthrax on the evils of hacking then.\\n\\nWhen they arrived at AFP headquarters, Anthrax made a point of putting\\nhis feet up on the leather couch in the reception area and opened a\\ncan of Coke he had brought along. His father got upset.\\n\\n`Get your feet off that seat. You shouldn\\'t have brought that can of\\nCoke. It doesn\\'t look very professional.\\'\\n\\n`Hey, I\\'m not going for a job interview here,\\' Anthrax responded.\\n\\nConstable Andrew Sexton, a redhead sporting two earrings, came up to\\nAnthrax and his father and took them upstairs for coffee. Detective\\nSergeant Ken Day, head of the Computer Crime Unit, was in a meeting,\\nSexton said, so the interview would be delayed a little.\\n\\nAnthrax\\'s father and Sexton found they shared some interests in law\\nenforcement. They discussed the problems associated with\\nrehabilitation and prisoner discipline. Joked with each other.\\nLaughed. Talked about `young Anthrax\\'. Young Anthrax did this. Young\\nAnthrax did that.\\n\\nYoung Anthrax felt sick. Watching his own father cosying up to the\\nenemy, talking as if he wasn\\'t even there.\\n\\nWhen Sexton went to check on whether Day had finished his meeting,\\nAnthrax\\'s father growled, `Wipe that look of contempt off your face,\\nyoung man. You are going to get nowhere in this world if you show that\\nkind of attitude, they are going to come down on you like a ton of\\nbricks.\\'\\n\\nAnthrax didn\\'t know what to say. Why should he treat these people with\\nany respect after the way they threatened his mother?\\n\\nThe interview room was small but very full. A dozen or more boxes, all\\nfilled with labelled print-outs.\\n\\nSexton began the interview. `Taped record of interview conducted at\\nAustralian Federal Police Headquarters, 383 Latrobe Street Melbourne\\non 29 November 1994.\\' He reeled off the names of the people present\\nand asked each to introduce himself for voice recognition.\\n\\n`As I have already stated, Detective Sergeant Day and I are making\\nenquiries into your alleged involvement into the manipulation of\\nprivate automated branch exchanges [PABXes] via Telecom 008 numbers in\\norder to obtain free phone calls nationally and internationally. Do\\nyou clearly understand this allegation?\\'\\n\\n`Yes.\\'\\n\\nSexton continued with the necessary, and important, preliminaries. Did\\nAnthrax understand that he was not obliged to answer any questions?\\nThat he had the right to communicate with a lawyer? That he had\\nattended the interview of his own free will? That he was free to leave\\nat any time?\\n\\nYes, Anthrax said in answer to each question.\\n\\nSexton then ploughed through a few more standard procedures before he\\nfinally got to the meat of the issue--telephones. He fished around in\\none of the many boxes and pulled out a mobile phone. Anthrax confirmed\\nthat it was his phone.\\n\\n`Was that the phone that you used to call the 008 numbers and\\nsubsequent connections?\\' Sexton asked.\\n\\n`Yes.\\'\\n\\n`Contained in that phone is a number of pre-set numbers. Do you\\nagree?\\'\\n\\n`Yes.\\'\\n\\n`I went to the trouble of extracting those records from it.\\' Sexton\\nlooked pleased with himself for hacking Anthrax\\'s speed-dial numbers\\nfrom the mobile. `Number 22 is of some interest to myself. It comes up\\nas Aaron. Could that be the person you referred to before as Aaron in\\nSouth Australia?\\'\\n\\n`Yes, but he is always moving house. He is a hard person to track\\ndown.\\'\\n\\nSexton went through a few more numbers, most of which Anthrax hedged.\\nHe asked Anthrax questions about his manipulation of the phone system,\\nparticularly about the way he made free calls overseas using\\nAustralian companies\\' 008 numbers.\\n\\nWhen Anthrax had patiently explained how it all worked, Sexton went\\nthrough some more speed-dial numbers.\\n\\n`Number 43. Do you recognise that one?\\'\\n\\n`That\\'s the Swedish Party Line.\\'\\n\\n`What about these other numbers? Such as 78? And 30?\\'\\n\\n`I\\'m not sure. I couldn\\'t say what any of these are. It\\'s been so\\nlong,\\' Anthrax paused, sensing the pressure from the other side of the\\ntable. `These ones here, they are numbers in my town. But I don\\'t know\\nwho. Very often, \\'cause I don\\'t have any pen and paper with me, I just\\nplug a number into the phone.\\'\\n\\nSexton looked unhappy. He decided to go in a little harder. `I\\'m going\\nto be pretty blunt. So far you have admitted to the 008s but I think\\nyou are understating your knowledge and your experience when it comes\\nto these sort of offences.\\' He caught himself. `Not offences. But your\\ninvolvement in all of this ... I think you have got a little bit more\\n... I\\'m not saying you are lying, don\\'t get me wrong, but you tend to\\nbe pulling yourself away from how far you were really into this. And\\nhow far everyone looked up to you.\\'\\n\\nThere was the gauntlet, thrown down on the table. Anthrax picked it\\nup.\\n\\n`They looked up to me? That was just a perception. To be honest, I\\ndon\\'t know that much. I couldn\\'t tell you anything about telephone\\nexchanges or anything like that. In the past, I guess the reason they\\nmight look up to me in the sense of a leader is because I was doing\\nthis, as you are probably aware, quite a bit in the past, and\\nsubsequently built up a reputation. Since then I decided I wouldn\\'t do\\nit again.\\'\\n\\n`Since this?\\' Sexton was quick off the mark.\\n\\n`No. Before. I just said, \"I don\\'t want anything to do with this any\\nmore. It\\'s just stupid\". When I broke up with my girlfriend ... I just\\ngot dragged into it again. I\\'m not trying to say that I am any less\\nresponsible for any of this but I will say I didn\\'t originate any of\\nthese 008s. They were all scanned by other people. But I made calls\\nand admittedly I did a lot of stupid things.\\'\\n\\nBut Sexton was like a dog with a bone.\\n\\n`I just felt that you were tending to ... I don\\'t know if it\\'s because\\nyour dad\\'s here or ... I have read stuff that \"Anthrax was a legend\\nwhen it came to this, and he was a scanner, and he was the man to talk\\nto about X.25, Tymnet, hacking, Unix. The whole kit and kaboodle\".\\'\\n\\nAnthrax didn\\'t take the bait. Cops always try that line. Play on a\\nhacker\\'s ego, get them to brag. It was so transparent.\\n\\n`It\\'s not true,\\' he answered. `I know nothing about ... I can\\'t\\nprogram. I have an Amiga with one meg of memory. I have no formal\\nbackground in computers whatsoever.\\'\\n\\nThat part was definitely true. Everything was self-taught. Well,\\nalmost everything. He did take one programming class at uni, but he\\nfailed it. He went to the library to do extra research, used in his\\nfinal project for the course. Most of his classmates wrote simple\\n200-line programs with few functions; his ran to 500 lines and had\\nlots of special functions. But the lecturer flunked him. She told him,\\n`The functions in your program were not taught in this course\\'.\\n\\nSexton asked Anthrax if he was into carding, which he denied\\nemphatically. Then Sexton headed back into scanning. How much had\\nAnthrax done? Had he given scanned numbers to other hackers? Anthrax\\nwas evasive, and both cops were getting impatient.\\n\\n`What I am trying to get at is that I believe that, through your\\nscanning, you are helping other people break the law by promoting this\\nsort of thing.\\' Sexton had shown his hand.\\n\\n`No more than a telephone directory would be assisting someone,\\nbecause it\\'s really just a list. I didn\\'t actually break anything. I\\njust looked at it.\\'\\n\\n`These voice mailbox systems obviously belong to people. What would\\nyou do when you found a VMB?\\'\\n\\n`Just play with it. Give it to someone and say, \"Have a look at this.\\nIt is interesting,\" or whatever.\\'\\n\\n`When you say play with it you would break the code out to the VMB?\\'\\n\\n`No. Just have a look around. I\\'m not very good at breaking VMBs.\\'\\n\\nSexton tried a different tack. `What are 1-900 numbers? On the back of\\nthat document there is a 1-900 number. What are they generally for?\\'\\n\\nEasy question. `In America they like cost $10 a minute. You can ring\\nthem up, I think, and get all sorts of information, party lines, etc.\\'\\n\\n`It\\'s a conference type of call?\\'\\n\\n`Yes.\\'\\n\\n`Here is another document, contained in a clear plastic sleeve\\nlabelled AS/AB/S/1. Is this a scan? Do you recognise your\\nhandwriting?\\'\\n\\n`Yes, it\\'s in my handwriting. Once again it\\'s the same sort of scan.\\nIt\\'s just dialling some commercial numbers and noting them.\\'\\n\\n`And once you found something, what would you do with it?\\'\\n\\nAnthrax had no intention of being painted as some sort of ringleader\\nof a scanning gang. He was a sociable loner, not a part of a team.\\n\\n`I\\'d just look at it, like in the case of this one here--630. I just\\npunched in a few numbers and it said that 113 diverts somewhere, 115\\nsays goodbye, etc. I\\'d just do that and I probably never came back to\\nit again.\\'\\n\\n`And you believe that if I pick up the telephone book, I would get all\\nthis information?\\'\\n\\n`No. It\\'s just a list of numbers in the same sense that a telephone\\nbook is.\\'\\n\\n`What about a 1-800 number?\\'\\n\\n`That is the same as a 0014.\\'\\n\\n`If you rang a 1-800 number, where would you go?\\'\\n\\nAnthrax wondered if the Computer Crimes Unit gained most of its\\ntechnical knowledge from interviews with hackers.\\n\\n`You can either do 0014 or you can do 1-800. It\\'s just the same.\\'\\n\\n`Is it Canada--0014?\\'\\n\\n`It\\'s everywhere.\\' Oops. Don\\'t sound too cocky. `Isn\\'t it?\\'\\n\\n`No, I\\'m not familiar.\\' Which is just what Anthrax was thinking.\\n\\nSexton moved on. `On the back of that document there is more type\\nscans ...\\'\\n\\n`It\\'s all just the same thing. Just take a note of what is there. In\\nthis case, box 544 belongs to this woman ...\\'\\n\\n`So, once again, you just release this type of information on the\\nbridge?\\'\\n\\n`Not all of it. Most of it I would probably keep to myself and never\\nlook at it again. I was bored. Is it illegal to scan?\\'\\n\\n`I\\'m not saying it\\'s illegal. I\\'m just trying to show that you were\\nreally into this. I\\'m building a picture and I am gradually getting to\\na point and I\\'m going to build a picture to show that for a while\\nthere ...\\' Sexton then interrupted himself and veered down a less\\nconfrontational course. `I\\'m not saying you are doing it now, but back\\nthen, when all these offences occurred, you were really into scanning\\ntelephone systems, be it voice mailboxes ... I\\'m not saying you found\\nthe 008s but you ... anything to bugger up Telecom. You were really\\ngetting into it and you were helping other people.\\'\\n\\nAnthrax took offence. `The motivation for me doing it wasn\\'t to bugger\\nup Telecom.\\'\\n\\nSexton backpedalled. `Perhaps ... probably a poor choice of words.\\'\\n\\nHe began pressing forward on the subject of hacking, something the\\npolice had not said they were going to be discussing. Anthrax felt a\\nlittle unnerved, even rattled.\\n\\nDay asked if Anthrax wanted a break.\\n\\n`No,\\' he answered. `I just want to get it over and done with, if\\nthat\\'s OK. I\\'m not going to lie. I\\'m not going to say \"no comment\".\\nI\\'m going to admit to everything \\'cause, based on what I have been\\ntold, it\\'s in my best interest to do so.\\'\\n\\nThe police paused. They didn\\'t seem to like that last comment much.\\nDay tried to clear things up.\\n\\n`Before we go any further, based on what you have been told, it is in\\nyour best interests to tell the truth. Was it any member of the AFP\\nthat told you this?\\'\\n\\n`Yes.\\'\\n\\n`Who?\\' Day threw the question out quickly.\\n\\nAnthrax couldn\\'t remember their names. `The ones who came to my house.\\nI think Andrew also said it to me,\\' he said, nodding in the direction\\nof the red-headed constable.\\n\\nWhy were the cops getting so uncomfortable all of a sudden? It was no\\nsecret that they had told both Anthrax and his mother repeatedly that\\nit was in his best interest to agree to an interview.\\n\\nDay leaned forward, peered at Anthrax and asked, `What did you\\ninterpret that to mean?\\'\\n\\n`That if I don\\'t tell the truth, if I say \"no comment\" and don\\'t\\ncooperate, that it is going to be ... it will mean that you will go\\nafter me with ...\\' Anthrax grasped for the right words, but he felt\\ntongue-tied, `with ... more force, I guess.\\'\\n\\nBoth officers stiffened visibly.\\n\\nDay came back again. `Do you feel that an unfair inducement has been\\nplaced on you as a result of that?\\'\\n\\n`In what sense?\\' The question was genuine.\\n\\n`You have made the comment and it has now been recorded and I have to\\nclear it up. Do you feel like, that a deal has been offered to you at\\nany stage?\\'\\n\\nA deal? Anthrax thought about it. It wasn\\'t a deal as in `Talk to us\\nnow and we will make sure you don\\'t go to jail\\'. Or `Talk now and we\\nwon\\'t beat you with a rubber hose\\'.\\n\\n`No,\\' he answered.\\n\\n`Do you feel that as a result of that being said that you have been\\npressured to come forward today and tell the truth?\\'\\n\\nAh, that sort of deal. Well, of course.\\n\\n`Yes, I have been pressured,\\' Anthrax answered. The two police\\nofficers looked stunned. Anthrax paused, concerned about the growing\\nfeeling of disapproval in the room. `Indirectly,\\' he added quickly,\\nalmost apologetically.\\n\\nFor a brief moment, Anthrax just didn\\'t care. About the police. About\\nhis father. About the pressure. He would tell the truth. He decided to\\nexplain the situation as he saw it.\\n\\n`Because since they came to my house, they emphasised the fact that if\\nI didn\\'t come for an interview, that they would then charge my mother\\nand, as my mother is very sick, I am not prepared to put her through\\nthat.\\'\\n\\nThe police looked at each other. The shock waves reverberated around\\nthe room. The AFP clearly hadn\\'t bargained on this coming out in the\\ninterview tape. But what he said about his mother being threatened was\\nthe truth, so let it be on the record with everything else.\\n\\nKen Day caught his breath, `So you are saying that you\\nhave now been ...\\' he cut himself off ... `that you are not here\\nvoluntarily?\\'\\n\\nAnthrax thought about it. What did `voluntarily\\' mean? The police\\ndidn\\'t cuff him to a chair and tell him he couldn\\'t leave until he\\ntalked. They didn\\'t beat him around the head with a baton. They\\noffered him a choice: talk or inflict the police on his ailing mother.\\nNot a palatable choice, but a choice nonetheless. He chose to talk to\\nprotect his mother.\\n\\n`I am here voluntarily,\\' he answered.\\n\\n`That is not what you have said. What you have just said is\\nthat pressure has been placed on you and that you have had to come in\\nhere and answer the questions. Otherwise certain actions would take\\nplace. That does not mean you are here\\nvoluntarily.\\'\\n\\nThe police must have realised they were on very thin ice and Anthrax\\nfelt pressure growing in the room. The cops pushed. His father did not\\nlooked pleased.\\n\\n`I was going to come anyway,\\' Anthrax answered, again almost\\napologetically. Walk the tightrope, he thought. Don\\'t get them too mad\\nor they will charge my mother. `You can talk to the people who carried\\nout the warrant. All along, I said to them I would come in for an\\ninterview. Whatever my motivations are, I don\\'t think should matter. I\\nam going to tell you the truth.\\'\\n\\n`It does matter,\\' Day responded, `because at the beginning of the\\ninterview it was stated--do you agree--that you have come in here\\nvoluntarily?\\'\\n\\n`I have. No-one has forced me.\\'\\n\\nAnthrax felt exasperated. The room was getting stuffy. He wanted to\\nfinish this thing and get out of there. So much pressure.\\n\\n`And is anyone forcing you to make the answers you have given here\\ntoday?\\' Day tried again.\\n\\n`No individuals are forcing me, no.\\' There. You have what you want.\\nNow get on with it and let\\'s get out of here.\\n\\n`You have to tell the truth. Is that what you are saying?\\' The police\\nwould not leave the issue be.\\n\\n`I want to tell the truth. As well.\\' The key words there were `as\\nwell\\'. Anthrax thought, I want to and I have to.\\n\\n`It\\'s the circumstances that are forcing this upon you, not an\\nindividual?\\'\\n\\n`No.\\' Of course it was the circumstances. Never mind that the police\\ncreated the circumstance.\\n\\nAnthrax felt as if the police were just toying with him. He knew and\\nthey knew they would go after his mother if this interview wasn\\'t to\\ntheir liking. Visions of his frail mother being hauled out of her\\nhouse by the AFP flashed through his mind. Anthrax felt sweaty and\\nhot. Just get on with it. Whatever makes them happy, just agree to it\\nin order to get out of this crowded room.\\n\\n`So, would it be fair to summarise it, really, to say that perhaps ...\\nof your activity before the police arrived at your premises, that is\\nwhat is forcing you?\\'\\n\\nWhat was this cop talking about? His `activity\\' forcing him? Anthrax\\nfelt confused. The interview had already gone on some time. The cops\\nhad such obscure ways of asking things. The room was oppressively\\nsmall.\\n\\nDay pressed on with the question, `The fact that you could see you had\\nbroken the law, and that is what is forcing you to come forward here\\ntoday and tell the truth?\\'\\n\\nYeah. Whatever you want. `OK,\\' Anthrax started to answer, `That is a\\nfair assump--\\'\\n\\nDay cut him off. `I just wanted to clarify that because the\\ninterpretation I immediately got from that was that we, or members of\\nthe AFP, had unfairly and unjustly forced you to come in here today,\\nand that is not the case?\\'\\n\\nDefine `unfairly\\'. Define `unjustly\\'. Anthrax thought it was unfair\\nthe cops might charge his mother. But they told her it was perfectly\\nlegal to do so. Anthrax felt light-headed. All these thoughts whirring\\naround inside his head.\\n\\n`No, that is not the case. I\\'m sorry for ...\\' Be humble. Get out of\\nthat room faster.\\n\\n`No, that is OK. If that is what you believe, say it. I have no\\nproblems with that. I just like to have it clarified. Remember, other\\npeople might listen to this tape and they will draw inferences and\\nopinions from it. At any point where I think there is an ambiguity, I\\nwill ask for clarification. Do you understand that?\\'\\n\\n`Yes. I understand.\\' Anthrax couldn\\'t really focus on what Day was\\nsaying. He was feeling very distressed and just wanted to finish the\\ninterview.\\n\\nThe cops finally moved on, but the new topic was almost as unpleasant.\\nDay began probing about Anthrax\\'s earlier hacking career--the one he\\nhad no intention of talking about. Anthrax began to feel a bit better.\\nHe agreed to talk to the police about recent phreaking activities, not\\nhacking matters. Indeed, he had repeatedly told them that topic was\\nnot on his agenda. He felt like he was standing on firmer ground.\\n\\nAfter being politely stonewalled, Day circled around and tried again.\\n`OK. I will give you another allegation; that you have unlawfully\\naccessed computer systems in Australia and the United States. In the\\nUS, you specifically targeted military computer systems. Do you\\nunderstand that allegation?\\'\\n\\n`I understand that. I wouldn\\'t like to comment on it.\\' No, sir. No\\nway.\\n\\nDay tried a new tack. `I will further allege that you did work with a\\nperson known as Mendax.\\'\\n\\nWhat on earth was Day talking about? Anthrax had heard of Mendax, but\\nthey had never worked together. He thought the cops must not have very\\ngood informants.\\n\\n`No. That is not true. I know no-one of that name.\\' Not strictly true,\\nbut true enough.\\n\\n`Well, if he was to turn around to me and say that you were doing all\\nthis hacking, he would be lying, would he?\\'\\n\\nOh wonderful. Some other hacker was crapping on to the cops with lies\\nabout how he and Anthrax had worked together. That was exactly why\\nAnthrax didn\\'t work in a group. He had plenty of real allegations to\\nfend off. He didn\\'t need imaginary ones too.\\n\\n`Most certainly would. Unless he goes by some other name, I know\\nno-one by that name, Mendax.\\' Kill that off quick.\\n\\nIn fact Mendax had not ratted on Anthrax at all. That was just a\\ntechnique the police used.\\n\\n`You don\\'t wish to comment on the fact that you have hacked into other\\ncomputer systems and military systems?\\' If there\\nwas one thing Anthrax could say for Day, it was that he was\\npersistent.\\n\\n`No. I would prefer not to comment on any of that. This is the advice\\nI have received: not to comment on anything unrelated to the topic\\nthat I was told I would be talking about when I came down here.\\'\\n\\n`All right, well are you going to answer any questions in relation to\\nunlawfully accessing any computer systems?\\'\\n\\n`Based upon the legal advice that I received, I choose not to.\\'\\n\\nDay pursed his lips. `All right. If that is your attitude and you\\ndon\\'t wish to answer any of those questions, we won\\'t pursue the\\nmatter. However, I will inform you now that the matter may be reported\\nand you may receive a summons to answer the questions or face charges\\nin relation to those allegations, and, at any time that you so choose,\\nyou can come forward and tell us the truth.\\'\\n\\nWoah. Anthrax took a deep breath. Could the cops make him come answer\\nquestions with a summons? They were changing the game midway through.\\nAnthrax felt as though the carpet had been pulled out from beneath his\\nfeet. He needed a few minutes to clear his head.\\n\\n`Is it something I can think over and discuss?\\' Anthrax asked.\\n\\n`Yes. Do you want to have a pause and a talk with your father? The\\nconstable and I can step out of the room, or offer you another room.\\nYou may wish to have a break and think about it if you like. I think\\nit might be a good idea. I think we might have a ten-minute break and\\nput you in another room and let you two have a chat about it. There is\\nno pressure.\\'\\n\\nDay and the Sexton stopped the interview and guided father and son\\ninto another room. Once they were alone, Anthrax looked to his father\\nfor support. This voice inside him still cried out to keep away from\\nhis earlier hacking journeys. He needed someone to tell him the same\\nthing.\\n\\nHis father was definitely not that someone. He railed against Anthrax\\nwith considerable vehemence. Stop holding back. You have to tell\\neverything. How could you be so stupid? You can\\'t fool the police.\\nThey know. Confess it all before it\\'s too late. At the end of the\\nten-minute tirade, Anthrax felt worse than he had at the beginning.\\n\\nWhen the two returned to the interview room, Anthrax\\'s father turned\\nto the police and said suddenly, `He has decided to confess\\'.\\n\\nThat was not true. Anthrax hadn\\'t decided anything of the sort. His\\nfather was full of surprises. It seemed every time he opened his\\nmouth, an ugly surprise came out.\\n\\nKen Day and Andrew Sexton warmed up a shaky Anthrax by showing him\\nvarious documents, pieces of paper with Anthrax\\'s scribbles seized\\nduring the raid, telephone taps. At one stage, Day pointed to some\\nhandwritten notes which read `KDAY\\'. He looked at Anthrax.\\n\\n`What\\'s that? That\\'s me.\\'\\n\\nAnthrax smiled for the first time in a long while. It was something to\\nbe happy about. The head of the AFP\\'s Computer Crime Unit in Melbourne\\nsat there, so sure he was onto something big. There was his name, bold\\nas day, in the hacker\\'s handwriting on a bit of paper seized in a\\nraid. Day seemed to be expecting something good.\\n\\nAnthrax said, `If you ring that up you will find it is a radio\\nstation.\\' An American radio station. Written on the same bit of paper\\nwere the names of an American clothing store, another US-based radio\\nstation, and a few records he wanted to order.\\n\\n`There you go,\\' Day laughed at his own hasty conclusions. `I\\'ve got a\\nradio station named after me.\\'\\n\\nDay asked Anthrax why he wrote down all sorts of things, directory\\npaths, codes, error messages.\\n\\n`Just part of the record-keeping. I think I wrote this down when I had\\nfirst been given this dial-up and I was just feeling my way around,\\ntaking notes of what different things did.\\'\\n\\n`What were your intentions at the time with these computer networks?\\'\\n\\n`At this stage, I was just having a look, just a matter of curiosity.\\'\\n\\n`Was it a matter of curiosity--\"Gee, this is interesting\" or was it\\nmore like \"I would like to get into them\" at this stage?\\'\\n\\n`I couldn\\'t say what was going through my mind at the time. But\\ninitially once I got into the first system--I\\'m sure you have heard\\nthis a lot--but once you get into the first system, it\\'s like you get\\ninto the next one and the next one and the next one, after a while it\\ndoesn\\'t ...\\' Anthrax couldn\\'t find the right words to finish the\\nexplanation.\\n\\n`Once you have tasted the forbidden fruit?\\'\\n\\n`Exactly. It\\'s a good analogy.\\'\\n\\nDay pressed on with questions about Anthrax\\'s hacking. He successfully\\nelicited admissions from the hacker. Anthrax gave Day more than the\\npolice officer had before, but probably not as much as he would have\\nliked.\\n\\nIt was, however, enough. Enough to keep the police from charging\\nAnthrax\\'s mother. And enough for them to charge him.\\n\\n\\nAnthrax didn\\'t see his final list of charges until the day he appeared\\nin court on 28 August 1995. The whole case seemed to be a bit\\ndisorganised. His Legal Aid lawyer had little knowledge of computers,\\nlet alone computer crime. He told Anthrax he could ask for an\\nadjournment because he hadn\\'t seen the final charges until so late,\\nbut Anthrax wanted to get the thing over and done with. They had\\nagreed that Anthrax would plead guilty to the charges and hope for a\\nreasonable magistrate.\\n\\nAnthrax looked through the hand-up brief provided by the prosecution,\\nwhich included a heavily edited transcript of his interview with the\\npolice. It was labelled as a `summary\\', but it certainly didn\\'t\\nsummarise everything important in that interview. Either the\\nprosecution or the police had cut out all references to the fact that\\nthe police had threatened to charge Anthrax\\'s mother if he didn\\'t\\nagree to be interviewed.\\n\\nAnthrax pondered the matter. Wasn\\'t everything relevant to his case\\nsupposed to be covered in a hand-up brief? This seemed very relevant\\nto his case, yet there wasn\\'t a mention of it anywhere in the\\ndocument. He began to wonder if the police had edited down the\\ntranscript just so they could cut out that portion of the interview.\\nPerhaps the judge wouldn\\'t be too happy about it. He thought that\\nmaybe the police didn\\'t want to be held accountable for how they had\\ndealt with his mother.\\n\\nThe rest of the hand-up brief wasn\\'t much better. The only statement\\nby an actual `witness\\' to Anthrax\\'s hacking was from his former\\nroom-mate, who claimed that he had watched Anthrax break into a NASA\\ncomputer and access an `area of the computer system which showed the\\nlatitude/longitude of ships\\'.\\n\\nDid space ships even have longitudes and latitudes? Anthrax didn\\'t\\nknow. And he had certainly never broken into a NASA computer in front\\nof the room-mate. It was absurd. This guy is lying, Anthrax thought,\\nand five minutes under cross-examination by a reasonable lawyer would\\nillustrate as much. Anthrax\\'s instincts told him the prosecution had a\\nflimsy case for some of the charges, but he felt overwhelmed by\\npressure from all sides--his family, the bustle in the courtroom, even\\nthe officiousness of his own lawyer quickly rustling through his\\npapers.\\n\\nAnthrax looked around the room. His eyes fell on his father, who sat\\nwaiting on the public benches. Anthrax\\'s lawyer wanted him there to\\ngive evidence during sentencing. He thought it would look good to show\\nthere was a family presence. Anthrax gave the suggestion a cool\\nreception. But he didn\\'t understand how courts worked, so he followed\\nhis lawyer\\'s advice.\\n\\nAnthrax\\'s mother was back at his apartment, waiting for news. She had\\nbeen on night duty and was supposed to be sleeping. That was the\\nostensible reason she didn\\'t attend. Anthrax thought perhaps that the\\ntension was too much for her. Whatever the reason, she didn\\'t sleep\\nall that day. She tidied the place, washed the dishes, did the\\nlaundry, and kept herself as busy as the tiny apartment would allow\\nher.\\n\\nAnthrax\\'s girlfriend, a pretty, moon-faced Turkish girl, also came to\\ncourt. She had never been into the hacking scene. A group of school\\nchildren, mostly girls, chatted in the rows behind her.\\n\\nAnthrax read through the four-page summary of facts provided by the\\nprosecution. When he reached the final page, his heart stopped. The\\nfinal paragraph said:\\n\\n31. Penalty\\n\\ns85ZF (a)--12 months, $6000 or both\\n\\ns76E(a)--2 years, $12000 or both\\n\\nPointing to the last paragraph, Anthrax asked his lawyer what that was\\nall about. His lawyer told him that he would probably get prison but,\\nwell, it wouldn\\'t be that bad and he would just have `to take it on\\nthe chin\\'. He would, after all, be out in a year or two.\\n\\nRapists sometimes got off with less than that. Anthrax couldn\\'t\\nbelieve the prosecution was asking for prison. After he cooperated,\\nsuffering through that miserable interview. He had no prior\\nconvictions. But the snowball had been set in motion. The magistrate\\nappeared and opened the court.\\n\\nAnthrax felt he couldn\\'t back out now and he pleaded guilty to 21\\ncounts, including one charge of inserting data and twenty charges of\\ndefrauding or attempting to defraud a carrier.\\n\\nHis lawyer put the case for a lenient sentence. He called Anthrax\\'s\\nfather up on the stand and asked him questions about his son. His\\nfather probably did more harm than good. When asked if he thought his\\nson would offend again, his father replied, `I don\\'t know\\'.\\n\\nAnthrax was livid. It was further unconscionable behaviour. Not long\\nbefore the trial, Anthrax had discovered that his father had planned\\nto sneak out of the country two days before the court case. He was\\ngoing overseas, he told his wife, but not until after the court case.\\nIt was only by chance that she discovered his surreptitious plans to\\nleave early. Presumably he would find his son\\'s trial humiliating.\\nAnthrax\\'s mother insisted he stayed and he begrudgingly delayed the\\ntrip.\\n\\nHis father sat down, a bit away from Anthrax and his lawyer. The\\nlawyer provided a colourful alternative to the prosecutor. He perched\\none leg up on his bench, rested an elbow on the knee and stroked his\\nlong, red beard. It was an impressive beard, more than a foot long and\\nthick with reddish brown curls. Somehow it fitted with his two-tone\\nchocolate brown suit and his tie, a breathtakingly wide creation with\\nwild patterns in gold. The suit was one size too small. He launched\\ninto the usual courtroom flourish--lots of words saying nothing. Then\\nhe got to the punch line.\\n\\n`Your worship, this young man has been in all sorts of places. NASA,\\nmilitary sites, you wouldn\\'t believe some of the places he has been.\\'\\n\\n`I don\\'t think I want to know where he has been,\\' the magistrate\\nanswered wryly.\\n\\nThe strategy was Anthrax\\'s. He thought he could turn a\\nliability into an asset by showing that he had been in many\\nsystems--many sensitive systems--but had done no malicious damage in\\nany of them.\\n\\nThe strategy worked and the magistrate announced there was no way he\\nwas sending the young hacker to jail.\\n\\nThe prosecutor looked genuinely disappointed and launched a counter\\nproposal--1500 hours of community service. Anthrax caught his breath.\\nThat was absurd. It would take almost nine months, full time. Painting\\nbuildings, cleaning toilets. Forget about his university studies. It was\\nalmost as bad as prison.\\n\\nAnthrax\\'s lawyer protested. `Your Worship, that penalty is something\\nout of cyberspace.\\' Anthrax winced at how corny that sounded, but the\\nlawyer looked very pleased with himself.\\n\\nThe magistrate refused to have a bar of the prosecutor\\'s counter\\nproposal. Anthrax\\'s girlfriend was impressed with the magistrate. She\\ndidn\\'t know much about the law or the court system, but he seemed a\\nfair man, a just man. He didn\\'t appear to want to give a harsh\\npunishment to Anthrax at all. But he told the court he had to send a\\nmessage to Anthrax, to the class of school children in the public\\nbenches and to the general community that hacking was wrong in the\\neyes of the law. Anthrax glanced back at the students. They looked\\nlike they were aged thirteen or fourteen, about the age he got into\\nhacking and phreaking.\\n\\nThe magistrate announced his sentence. Two hundred hours of community\\nservice and $6116.90 of restitution to be paid to two telephone\\ncompanies--Telecom and Teleglobe in Canada. It wasn\\'t prison, but it was\\na staggering amount of money for a student to rake up. He had a year to\\npay it off, and it would definitely take that long. At least he was\\nfree.\\n\\nAnthrax\\'s girlfriend thought how unlucky it was to have landed those\\ngiggling school children in the courtroom on that day. They laughed\\nand pointed and half-whispered. Court was a game. They didn\\'t seem to\\ntake the magistrate\\'s warning seriously. Perhaps they were gossiping\\nabout the next party. Perhaps they were chatting about a new pair of\\nsneakers or a new CD.\\n\\nAnd maybe one or two murmured quietly how cool it would be to break\\ninto NASA.\\n\\n                                 Afterword.\\n\\n\\nIt was billed as the `largest annual gathering of those in, related\\nto, or wishing to know more about the computer underground\\', so I\\nthought I had better go.\\n\\nHoHoCon in Austin, Texas, was without a doubt one of the strangest\\nconferences I have attended. During the weekend leading up to New Year\\'s\\nDay 1995, the Ramada Inn South was overrun by hackers, phreakers,\\nex-hackers, underground sympathisers, journalists, computer company\\nemployees and American law enforcement agents. Some people had come from\\nas far away as Germany and Canada.\\n\\nThe hackers and phreakers slept four or six to a room--if they slept\\nat all. The feds slept two to a room. I could be wrong; maybe they\\nweren\\'t feds at all. But they seemed far too well dressed and well\\npressed to be anything else. No one else at HoHoCon ironed their\\nT-shirts.\\n\\nI left the main conference hall and wandered into Room 518--the\\ncomputer room--sat down on one of the two hotel beds which had been\\nshoved into a corner to make room for all the computer gear, and\\nwatched. The conference organisers had moved enough equipment in there\\nto open a store, and then connected it all to the Internet. For nearly\\nthree days, the room was almost continuously full. Boys in their late\\nteens or early twenties lounged on the floor talking, playing with\\ntheir cell phones and scanners or tapping away at one of the six or\\nseven terminals. Empty bags of chips, Coke cans and pizza boxes\\nlittered the room. The place felt like one giant college dorm floor\\nparty, except that the people didn\\'t talk to each other so much as to\\ntheir computers.\\n\\nThese weren\\'t the only interesting people at the con. I met up with an\\nolder group of nonconformists in the computer industry, a sort of\\nAustin intelligentsia. By older, I mean above the age of 26. They were\\ninterested in many of the same issues as the young group of\\nhackers--privacy, encryption, the future of a digital world--and they\\nall had technical backgrounds.\\n\\nThis loose group of blue-jean clad thinkers, people like Doug Barnes,\\nJeremy Porter and Jim McCoy, like to meet over enchiladas and\\nmargueritas at university-style cafes. They always seemed to have\\nthree or four projects on the run. Digital cash was the flavour of the\\nmonth when I met them. They were unconventional, perhaps even a little\\nweird, but they were also bright, very creative and highly innovative.\\nThey were just the sort of people who might marry creative ideas with\\nmaturity and business sense, eventually making widespread digital cash\\na reality.\\n\\nI began to wonder how many of the young men in Room 518 might follow\\nthe same path. And I asked myself: where are these people in\\nAustralia?\\n\\nLargely invisible or perhaps even non-existent, it seems. Except maybe\\nin the computer underground. The underground appears to be one of the\\nfew places in Australia where madness, creativity, obsession,\\naddiction and rebellion collide like atoms in a cyclotron.\\n\\n\\nAfter the raids, the arrests and the court cases on three continents,\\nwhat became of the hackers described in this book?\\n\\nMost of them went on to do interesting and constructive things with\\ntheir lives. Those who were interviewed for this work say they have\\ngiven up hacking for good. After what many of them had been through, I\\nwould be surprised if any of them continued hacking.\\n\\nMost of them, however, are not sorry for their hacking activities.\\nSome are sorry they upset people. They feel badly that they caused\\nsystem admins stress and unhappiness by hacking their systems. But\\nmost do not feel hacking is wrong--and few, if any, feel that\\n`look-see hacking\\', as prosecuting barrister Geoff Chettle termed\\nnon-malicious hacking, should be a crime.\\n\\nFor the most part, their punishments have only hardened their views on\\nthe subject. They know that in many cases the authorities have sought\\nto make examples of them, for the benefit of rest of the computer\\nunderground. The state has largely failed in this objective. In the\\neyes of many in the computer underground, these prosecuted hackers are\\nheroes.\\n\\nPAR\\n\\nWhen I met Par in Tucson, Arizona, he had travelled from a tiny,\\nsnow-laden Mid-Western town where he was living with his grandparents.\\nHe was looking for work, but hadn\\'t been able to find anything.\\n\\nAs I drove around the outskirts of Tucson, a little jetlagged and\\ndisoriented, I was often distracted from the road by the beauty of the\\nwinter sun on the Sonoran desert cacti. Sitting in the front passenger\\nseat, Par said calmly, `I always wondered what it would be like to\\ndrive on the wrong side of the road\\'.\\n\\nI swerved back to the right side of the road.\\n\\nPar is still like that. Easy-going, rolling with the punches, taking\\nwhat life hands him. He is also on the road again.\\n\\nHe moved back to the west coast for a while, but will likely pack up\\nand go somewhere else before long. He picks up temporary work where he\\ncan, often just basic, dull data-entry stuff. It isn\\'t easy. He can\\'t\\njust explain away a four-year gap in his resumÃ© with `Successfully\\ncompleted a telecommuting course for fugitives. Trained by the US\\nSecret Service\\'. He thought he might like to work at a local college\\ncomputer lab, helping out the students and generally keeping the\\nequipment running. Without any professional qualifications, that\\nseemed an unlikely option these days.\\n\\nAlthough he is no longer a fugitive, Par\\'s life hasn\\'t changed that\\nmuch. He speaks to his mother very occasionally, though they don\\'t\\nhave much in common. Escaping his computer crimes charges proved\\neasier than overcoming the effects of being a fugitive for so long on\\nhis personality and lifestyle. Now and again, the paranoia sets in\\nagain. It seems to come in waves. There aren\\'t many support mechanisms\\nin the US for an unemployed young man who doesn\\'t have health\\ninsurance.\\n\\nPRIME SUSPECT\\n\\nPrime Suspect has no regrets about his choices. He believed that he\\nand Mendax were headed in different directions in life. The friendship\\nwould have ended anyway, so he decided that he was not willing to go\\nto prison for Mendax.\\n\\nHe completed a TAFE course in computer programming and found a job in\\nthe burgeoning Internet industry. He likes his job. His employer, who\\nknows about his hacking convictions, recently gave him a pay rise. In\\nmid-1994, he gave up drugs for good. In 1995 he moved into a shared\\nhouse with some friends, and in August 1996 he stopped smoking\\ncigarettes.\\n\\nWithout hacking, there seems to be time in his life to do new things.\\nHe took up sky-diving. A single jump gives him a high which lasts for\\ndays, sometimes up to a week. Girls have captured his interest. He\\'s\\nhad a few girlfriends and thinks he would like to settle into a\\nserious relationship when he finds the right person.\\n\\nRecently, Prime Suspect has been studying martial arts. He tries to\\nattend at least four classes a week, sometimes more, and says he has a\\nspecial interest in the spiritual and philosophical sides of martial\\narts. Most days, he rises at 5 a.m., either to jog or to meditate.\\n\\nMENDAX\\n\\nIn 1992 Mendax and Trax teamed up with a wealthy Italian real-estate\\ninvestor, purchased La Trobe University\\'s mainframe computer\\n(ironically, a machine they had been accused of hacking) and started a\\ncomputer security company. The company eventually dissolved when the\\ninvestor disappeared following actions by his creditors.\\n\\nAfter a public confrontation in 1993 with Victorian Premier Jeff\\nKennett, Mendax and two others formed a civil rights organisation to\\nfight corruption and lack of accountability in a Victorian government\\ndepartment. As part of this ongoing effort, Mendax acted as a conduit\\nfor leaked documents and became involved in a number of court cases\\nagainst the department during 1993-94. Eventually, he gave evidence in\\ncamera to a state parliamentary committee examining the issues, and\\nhis organisation later facilitated the appearance of more than 40\\nwitnesses at an investigation by the Auditor-General.\\n\\nMendax volunteers his time and computer expertise for several other\\nnon-profit community organisations. He believes strongly in the\\nimportance of the non-profit sector, and spends much of his free time\\nas an activist on different community projects. Mendax has provided\\ninformation or assistance to law-enforcement bodies, but not against\\nhackers. He said, `I couldn\\'t ethically justify that. But as for\\nothers, such as people who prey on children or corporate spies, I am\\nnot concerned about using my skills there.\\'\\n\\nStill passionate about coding, Mendax donates his time to various\\ninternational programming efforts and releases some of his programs\\nfor free on the Internet. His philosophy is that most of the lasting\\nsocial advances in the history of man have been a direct result of new\\ntechnology.\\n\\nNorTel and a number of other organisations he was accused of hacking\\nuse his cryptography software--a fact he finds rather ironic.\\n\\nANTHRAX\\n\\nAnthrax moved to Melbourne, where he is completing a university course\\nand working on freelance assignments in the computer networking area\\nof a major corporation.\\n\\nHis father and mother are divorcing. Anthrax doesn\\'t talk to his\\nfather at all these days.\\n\\nAnthrax\\'s mother\\'s health has stabilised somewhat since the completion\\nof the court case, though her condition still gives her chronic pain.\\nDespite some skin discolouration caused by the disease, she looks\\nwell. As a result of her years of work in the local community, she has\\na loyal group of friends who support her through bad bouts of the\\nillness. She tries to live without bitterness and continues to have a\\ngood relationship with both her sons.\\n\\nAnthrax is no longer involved in the Nation of Islam, but he is still\\na devout Muslim. An acquaintance of his, an Albanian who ran a local\\nfish and chips shop, introduced him to a different kind of Islam. Not\\nlong after, Anthrax became a Sunni Muslim. He doesn\\'t drink alcohol or\\ngamble, and he attends a local mosque for Friday evening prayers. He\\ntries to read from the Qu\\'raan every day and to practise the tenets of\\nhis religion faithfully.\\n\\nWith his computer and business skills now sought after by industry, he\\nis exploring the possibility of moving to a Muslim country in Asia or\\nthe Middle East. He tries to promote the interests of Islam worldwide.\\n\\nMost of his pranking needs are now met by commercial CDs--recordings\\nof other people\\'s pranking sold through underground magazines and\\nAmerican mail order catalogues. Once in a long while, he still rings\\nMr McKenny in search of the missing shovel.\\n\\nAnthrax felt aggrieved at the outcome of his written complaint to the\\nOffice of the Ombudsman. In the complaint, Anthrax gave an account of\\nhow he believed the AFP had behaved inappropriately throughout his\\ncase. Specifically, he alleged that the AFP had pressured his mother\\nwith threats and had harassed him, taken photographs of him without\\nhis permission, given information to his university about his case\\nprior to the issue of a summons and the resolution of his case, and\\nmade racist comments toward him during the raid.\\n\\nIn 1995-96, a total of 1157 complaints were filed against the AFP, 683\\nof which were investigated by the Commonwealth Ombudsman. Of the\\ncomplaint investigations completed and reviewed, only 6 per cent were\\nsubstantiated. Another 9 per cent were deemed to be `incapable of\\ndetermination\\', about 34 per cent were `unsubstantiated\\', and in more\\nthan a quarter of all cases the Ombudsman either chose not to\\ninvestigate or not to continue to investigate a complaint.\\n\\nThe Office of the Ombudsman referred Anthrax\\'s matter to the AFP\\'s\\nInternal Investigations office. Although Anthrax and his mother both\\ngave statements to the investigating officers, there was no other\\nproof of Anthrax\\'s allegations. In the end, it came down to Anthrax\\nand his mother\\'s words against those of the police.\\n\\nThe AFP\\'s internal investigation concluded that Anthrax\\'s complaints\\ncould either not be substantiated or not be determined, in part due to\\nthe fact that almost two years had passed since the original raid. For\\nthe most part, the Ombudsman backed the AFP\\'s finding. No\\nrecommendation was made for the disciplining of any officers.\\n\\nAnthrax\\'s only consolation was a concern voiced by the Ombudsman\\'s\\nOffice. Although the investigating officer agreed with the AFP\\ninvestigators that the complaint could not be substantiated, she\\nwrote, `I am concerned that your mother felt she was compelled to\\npressure you into attending an interview based on a fear that she\\nwould be charged because her phone was used to perpetrate the\\noffences\\'.\\n\\nAnthrax remains angry and sceptical about his experience with the\\npolice. He believes a lot of things need to be changed about the way\\nthe police operate. Most of all, he believes that justice will never\\nbe assured in a system where the police are allowed to investigate\\nthemselves.\\n\\nPAD AND GANDALF\\n\\nAfter Pad and Gandalf were released from prison, they started up a\\nfree security advisory service on the Internet. One reason they began\\nreleasing 8lgm advisories, as they were known, was to help admins\\nsecure their own systems. The other reason was to thumb their noses at\\nthe conservatives in the security industry.\\n\\nMany on the Internet considered the 8lgm advisories to be the best\\navailable at the time--far better than anything CERT had ever\\nproduced. Pad and Gandalf were sending their own message back to the\\nestablishment. The message, though never openly stated, was something\\nlike this: `You busted us. You sent us to prison. But it didn\\'t\\nmatter. You can\\'t keep information like this secret. Further, we are\\nstill better than you ever were and, to prove it, we are going to beat\\nyou at your own game.\\'\\n\\nBelieving that the best way to keep a hacker out of your system is to\\nsecure it properly in the first place, the two British hackers\\nrejected security gurus who refused to tell the world about new\\nsecurity holes. Their 8lgm advisories began marginalising the\\ntraditional industry security reports, and helped to push the industry\\ntoward its current, more open attitude.\\n\\nPad and Gandalf now both work, doing computer programming jobs on\\ncontract, sometimes for financial institutions. Their clients like\\nthem and value their work. Both have steady girlfriends.\\n\\nPad doesn\\'t hack any more. The reason isn\\'t the risk of getting caught\\nor the threat of prison. He has stopped hacking because he has\\nrealised what a headache it is for a system administrator to clean up\\nhis or her computer after an attack. Searching through logs. Looking\\nfor backdoors the hacker might have left behind. The hours, the\\nhassle, the pressure--he thinks it is wrong to put anyone through\\nthat. Pad understands far better now how much strain a hacker\\nintrusion can cause another human being.\\n\\nThere is another reason Pad has given up hacking: he has simply\\noutgrown the desire. He says that he has better things to do with his\\ntime. Computers are a way for him to earn a living, not a way to spend\\nhis leisure time. After a trip overseas he decided that real\\ntravel--not its electronic cousin--was more interesting than hacking.\\nHe has also learned to play the guitar, something he believes he would\\nhave done years ago if he hadn\\'t spent so much time hacking.\\n\\nGandalf shares Pad\\'s interest in travelling. One reason they like\\ncontract work is because it lets them work hard for six months, save\\nsome money, and then take a few months off. The aim of both ex-hackers\\nfor now is simply to sling backpacks over their shoulders and bounce\\naround the globe.\\n\\nPad still thinks that Britain takes hacking far too seriously and he\\nis considering moving overseas permanently. The 8lgm court case made\\nhim wonder about the people in power in Britain--the politicians, the\\njudges, the law enforcement officers. He often thinks: what kind of\\npeople are running this show?\\n\\nSTUART GILL\\n\\nIn 1993, the Victorian Ombudsman1 and the Victoria Police2 both\\ninvestigated the leaking of confidential police information in\\nassociation with Operation Iceberg--a police investigation into\\nallegations of corruption against Assistant Commissioner of Police\\nFrank Green. Stuart Gill figured prominently in both reports.\\n\\nThe Victoria Police report concluded that `Gill was able to infiltrate\\nthe policing environment by skilfully manipulating himself and\\ninformation to the unsuspecting\\'. The Ombudsman concluded that a\\n`large quantity of confidential police information, mainly from the\\nISU database, was given to ... Gill by [Victoria Police officer]\\nCosgriff\\'.\\n\\nThe police report stated that Inspector Chris Cosgriff had\\ndeliberately leaked confidential police information to Gill, and\\nreported that he was `besotted with Gill\\'. Superintendent Tony Warren,\\nex-Deputy Commissioner John Frame and ex-Assistant Commissioner\\nBernice Masterston were also criticised in the report.\\n\\nThe Ombudsman concluded that Warren and Cosgriff\\'s relationship with\\nGill was `primarily responsible for the release of confidential\\ninformation\\'. Interestingly, however, the Ombudsman also stated,\\n`Whilst Mr Gill may have had his own agenda and taken advantage of his\\nrelationship with police, [the] police have equally used and in some\\ncases misused Mr Gill for their own purposes\\'.\\n\\nThe Ombudsman\\'s report further concluded that there was no evidence of\\ncriminal conduct by Frank Green, and that the `allegations made over\\nthe years against Mr Green should have been properly and fully\\ninvestigated at the time they were made\\'.\\n\\nPHOENIX\\n\\nAs his court case played in the media, Phoenix was speeding on his\\nmotorcycle through an inner-city Melbourne street one rainy night when\\nhe hit a car. The car\\'s driver leapt from the front seat and found a\\ndisturbing scene. Phoenix was sprawled across the road. His helmet had\\na huge crack on the side, where his head had hit the car\\'s petrol\\ntank, and petrol had spilled over the motorcycle and its rider.\\n\\nMiraculously, Phoenix was unhurt, though very dazed. Some bystanders\\nhelped him and the distraught driver to a nearby halfway house. They\\ncalled an ambulance, and then made the two traumatised young men some\\ntea in the kitchen. Phoenix\\'s mother arrived, called by a bystander at\\nPhoenix\\'s request. The ambulance workers confirmed that Phoenix had\\nnot broken any bones but they recommended he go to hospital to check\\nfor possible concussion.\\n\\nStill both badly shaken, Phoenix and the driver exchanged names and\\nphone numbers. Phoenix told the driver he did technical work for a\\n0055 telephone service, then said, `You might recognise me. I\\'m\\nPhoenix. There\\'s this big computer hacking case going on in\\ncourt--that\\'s my case\\'.\\n\\nThe driver looked at him blankly.\\n\\nPhoenix said, `You might have seen me on the TV news.\\'\\n\\nNo, the driver said, somewhat amazed at the strange things which go\\nthrough the dazed mind of a young man who has so narrowly escaped\\ndeath.\\n\\nSome time after Phoenix\\'s close brush with death, the former hacker\\nleft his info-line technician\\'s job and began working in the\\ninformation technology division of a large Melbourne-based\\ncorporation. Well paid in his new job, Phoenix is seen, once again, as\\nthe golden-haired boy. He helped to write a software program which\\nreduces waste in one of the production lines and reportedly saved the\\ncompany thousands of dollars. Now he travels abroad regularly, to\\nJapan and elsewhere.\\n\\nHe had a steady girlfriend for a time, but eventually she broke the\\nrelationship off to see other people. Heartbroken, he avoided dating\\nfor months. Instead, he filled his time with his ever-increasing\\ncorporate responsibilities.\\n\\nHis new interest is music. He plays electric guitar in an amateur\\nband.\\n\\nELECTRON\\n\\nA few weeks after his sentencing, Electron had another psychotic\\nepisode, triggered by a dose of speed. He was admitted to hospital\\nagain, this time at Larundel. After a short stay, he was released and\\nunderwent further psychiatric care.\\n\\nSome months later, he did speed again, and suffered another bout of\\npsychosis. He kept reading medical papers on the Internet about his\\ncondition and his psychiatrists worried that his detailed research\\nmight interfere with their ability to treat him.\\n\\nHe moved into special accommodation for people recovering from mental\\ninstabilities. Slowly, he struggled to overcome his illness. When\\npeople came up to him and said things like, `What a nice day it is!\\'\\nElectron willed himself to take their words at face value, to accept\\nthat they really were just commenting on the weather, nothing more.\\nDuring this time, he quit drugs, alcohol and his much-hated accounting\\ncourse. Eventually he was able to come off his psychiatric medicines\\ncompletely. He hasn\\'t taken drugs or had alcohol since December 1994.\\nHis only chemical vice in 1996 was cigarettes. By the beginning of\\n1997 he had also given up tobacco.\\n\\nElectron hasn\\'t talked to either Phoenix or Nom since 1992.\\n\\nIn early 1996, Electron moved into his own flat with his steady\\ngirlfriend, who studies dance and who also successfully overcame\\nmental illness after a long, hard struggle. Electron began another\\nuniversity course in a philosophy-related field. This time university\\nlife agreed with him, and his first semester transcript showed honours\\ngrades in every class. He is considering moving to Sydney for further\\nstudies.\\n\\nElectron worked off his 300 hours of community service by painting walls\\nand doing minor handyman work at a local primary school. Among the small\\nprojects the school asked him to complete was the construction of a\\nretaining wall. He designed and dug, measured and fortified. As he\\nfinished off the last of his court-ordered community service hours on\\nthe wall, he discovered that he was rather proud of his creation. Even\\nnow, once in a while, he drives past the school and looks at the wall.\\n\\nIt is still standing.\\n\\n\\nThere are still hacking cases in Australia. About the same time as\\nMendax\\'s case was being heard in Victoria, The Crawler pleaded guilty\\nto 23 indictable offences and thirteen summary offences--all hacking\\nrelated charges--in Brisbane District Court. On 20 December 1996, the\\n21-year-old Queenslander was given a three-year suspended prison\\nsentence, ordered to pay $5000 in reparations to various\\norganisations, and made to forfeit his modem and two computers. The\\nfirst few waves of hackers may have come and gone, but hacking is far\\nfrom dead. It is merely less visible.\\n\\nLaw enforcement agencies and the judiciaries of several countries have\\ntried to send a message to the next generation of would-be hackers.\\nThe message is this: Don\\'t hack.\\n\\nBut the next generation of elite hackers and phreakers have heard a\\nvery different message, a message which says: Don\\'t get caught.\\n\\nThe principle of deterrence has not worked with hackers at this level.\\nI\\'m not talking here about the codes-kids--the teeny-bopper, carding,\\nwanna-be nappies who hang out on IRC (Internet relay chat). I\\'m\\ntalking about the elite hackers. If anything, law enforcement\\ncrackdowns have not only pushed them further underground, they have\\nencouraged hackers to become more sophisticated than ever before in\\nthe way they protect themselves. Adversity is the mother of invention.\\n\\nWhen police officers march through the front door of a hacker\\'s home\\ntoday, they may be better prepared than their predecessors, but they\\nwill also be facing bigger hurdles.  Today, top hackers encrypt\\neverything sensitive. The data on their hard drives, their live data\\nconnections, even their voice conversations.\\n\\nSo, if hackers are still hacking, who are their targets?\\n\\nIt is a broad field. Any type of network provider--X.25, cellular\\nphone or large Internet provider. Computer vendors--the manufacturers\\nof software and hardware, routers, gateways, firewalls or phone\\nswitches. Military institutions, governments and banks seem to be a\\nlittle less fashionable these days, though there are still plenty of\\nattacks on these sorts of sites.\\n\\nAttacks on security experts are still common, but a new trend is the\\nincrease in attacks on other hackers\\' systems. One Australian hacker\\njoked, `What are the other hackers going to do? Call the Feds? Tell\\nthe AFP, \"Yes, officer, that\\'s right, some computer criminal broke\\ninto my machine and stole 20000 passwords and all my exploitation code\\nfor bypassing firewalls\".\\'\\n\\nFor the most part, elite hackers seem to work alone, because of the\\nwell-advertised risks of getting caught. There are still some\\nunderground hacking communities frequented by top hackers, most notably\\nUPT in Canada and a few groups like the l0pht in the US, but such groups\\nare far less common, and more fragmented than they used to be.\\n\\nThese hackers have reached a new level of sophistication, not just in\\nthe technical nature of their attacks, but in their strategies and\\nobjectives. Once, top hackers such as Electron and Phoenix were happy\\nto get copies of Zardoz, which listed security holes found by industry\\nexperts. Now top hackers find those holes themselves--by reading line\\nby line through the proprietary source code from places like DEC, HP,\\nCISCO, Sun and Microsoft.\\n\\nIndustrial espionage does not seem to be on the agenda, at least with\\nanyone I interviewed. I have yet to meet a hacker who has given\\nproprietary source code to a vendor\\'s competitor. I have, however, met\\na hacker who found one company\\'s proprietary source code inside the\\ncomputer of its competitor. Was that a legal copy of the source code?\\nWho knows? The hacker didn\\'t think so, but he kept his mouth shut\\nabout it, for obvious reasons.\\n\\nMost of the time, these hackers want to keep their original bugs as\\nquiet as possible, so vendors won\\'t release patches.\\n\\nThe second popular target is source code development machines. The top\\nhackers have a clear objective in this area: to install their own\\nbackdoors before the product is released. They call it `backdooring\\' a\\nprogram or an operating system. The word `backdoor\\' is now used as\\nboth a noun and a verb in the underground. Hackers are very nervous\\ndiscussing this subject, in part because they don\\'t want to see a\\ncomputer company\\'s stock dive and people lose their jobs.\\n\\nWhat kind of programs do these hackers want to backdoor? Targets\\nmentioned include at least one major Internet browser, a popular game,\\nan Internet packet filter and a database product used by law\\nenforcement agencies.\\n\\nA good backdoor is a very powerful device, creating a covert channel\\nthrough even the most sturdy of firewalls into the heart of an\\notherwise secure network. In a net browser, a backdoor would in theory\\nallow a hacker to connect directly into someone\\'s home computer every\\ntime he or she wandered around the World Wide Web. However, don\\'t\\nexpect hackers to invade your suburban home just yet. Most elite\\nhackers couldn\\'t care less about the average person\\'s home computer.\\n\\nPerhaps you are wondering who might be behind this sort of attack.\\nWhat sort of person would do this? There are no easy answers to that\\nquestion. Some hackers are good people, some are bad, just like any\\ngroup of people. The next generation of elite hackers are a diverse\\nbunch, and relaying their stories would take another book entirely.\\nHowever, I would like to introduce you to just one, to give you a\\nwindow into the future.\\n\\nMeet SKiMo.\\n\\nA European living outside Australia, SKiMo has been hacking for at\\nleast four years, although he probably only joined the ranks of\\nworld-class hackers in 1995 or 1996. Never busted. Young--between the\\nage of 18 and 25--and male. From a less than picture-perfect family.\\nFluent in English as a second language. Left-leaning in his\\npolitics--heading toward environmentally green parties and anarchy\\nrather than traditional labour parties. Smokes a little dope and\\ndrinks alcohol, but doesn\\'t touch the hard stuff.\\n\\nHis musical tastes include early Pink Floyd, Sullen, Dog Eat Dog,\\nBiohazard, old Ice-T, Therapy, Alanis Morissette, Rage Against the\\nMachine, Fear Factory, Life of Agony and Napalm Death. He reads\\nStephen King, Stephen Hawking, Tom Clancy and Aldous Huxley. And any\\ngood books about physics, chemistry or mathematics.\\n\\nShy in person, he doesn\\'t like organised team sports and is not very\\nconfident around girls. He has only had one serious girlfriend, but\\nthe relationship finished. Now that he hacks and codes about four to\\nfive hours per day on average, but sometimes up to 36 hours straight,\\nhe doesn\\'t have time for girls.\\n\\n`Besides,\\' he says, `I am rather picky when it comes to girls. Maybe\\nif the girl shared the same interests ... but those ones are hard to\\nfind.\\' He adds, by way of further explanation, `Girls are different\\nfrom hacking. You can\\'t just brute force them if all else fails.\\'\\n\\nSKiMo has never intentionally damaged a computer system, nor would he.\\nIndeed, when I asked him, he was almost offended by the question.\\nHowever, he has accidentally done damage on a few occasions. In at\\nleast one case, he returned to the system and fixed the problem\\nhimself.\\n\\nBored out of his mind for most of his school career, SKiMo spent a\\ngreat deal of time reading books in class--openly. He wanted to send\\nthe teacher a message without actually jacking up in class.\\n\\nHe got into hacking after reading a magazine article about people who\\nhacked answering machines and VMBs. At that time, he had no idea what\\na VMB was, but he learned fast. One Sunday evening, he sat down with\\nhis phone and began scanning. Soon he was into phreaking, and visiting\\nEnglish-speaking party lines. Somehow, he always felt more comfortable\\nspeaking in English, to native English-speakers, perhaps because he\\nfelt a little like an outsider in his own culture.\\n\\n`I have always had the thought to leave my country as soon as I can,\\'\\nhe said.\\n\\nFrom the phreaking, it was a short jump into hacking.\\n\\nWhat made him want to hack or phreak in the first place? Maybe it was\\nthe desire to screw over the universally hated phone company, or\\n`possibly the sheer lust for power\\' or then again, maybe he was simply\\nanswering his desire `to explore an intricate piece of technology\\'.\\nToday, however, he is a little clearer on why he continues to hack.\\n`My first and foremost motivation is to learn,\\' he said.\\n\\nWhen asked why he doesn\\'t visit his local university or library to\\nsatisfy that desire, he answered, `in books, you only learn theory. It\\nis not that I dislike the theory but computer security in real life is\\nmuch different from theory\\'. Libraries also have trouble keeping pace\\nwith the rate of technological change, SKiMo said. `Possibly, it is\\nalso just the satisfaction of knowing that what I learn is\\nproprietary--is \"inside knowledge\",\\' he added. There could, he said,\\nbe some truth in the statement that he likes learning in an\\nadrenalin-inducing environment.\\n\\nIs he addicted to computers? SKiMo says no, but the indications are\\nthere. By his own estimate, he has hacked between 3000 and 10000\\ncomputers in total. His parents--who have no idea what their son was\\nup to day and night on his computer--worry about his behaviour. They\\npulled the plug on his machine many times. In SKiMo\\'s own words, `they\\ntried everything to keep me away from it\\'.\\n\\nNot surprisingly, they failed. SKiMo became a master at hiding his\\nequipment so they couldn\\'t sneak in and take it away. Finally, when he\\ngot sick of battling them over it and he was old enough, he put his\\nfoot down. `I basically told them, \"Diz is ma f**kin\\' life and none o\\'\\nyer business, Nemo\"--but not in those words.\\'\\n\\nSKiMo says he hasn\\'t suffered from any mental illnesses or\\ninstabilities--except perhaps paranoia. But he says that paranoia is\\njustified in his case. In two separate incidents in 1996, he believed\\nhe was being followed. Try as he might, he couldn\\'t shake the tails\\nfor quite some time. Perhaps it was just a coincidence, but he can\\nnever really be sure.\\n\\nHe described one hacking attack to me to illustrate his current\\ninterests. He managed to get inside the internal network of a German\\nmobile phone network provider, DeTeMobil (Deutsche Telekom). A former\\nstate-owned enterprise which was transformed into a publicly listed\\ncorporation in January 1995, Deutsche Telekom is the largest\\ntelecommunications company in Europe and ranks number three in the\\nworld as a network operator. It employs almost a quarter of a million\\npeople. By revenue, which totalled about $A37 billion in 1995, it is\\none of the five largest companies in Germany.\\n\\nAfter carefully researching and probing a site, SKiMo unearthed a\\nmethod of capturing the encryption keys generated for DeTeMobil\\'s\\nmobile phone conversations.\\n\\nHe explained: `The keys are not fixed, in the sense that they are\\ngenerated once and then stored in some database. Rather, a key is\\ngenerated for each phone conversation by the company\\'s AUC\\n[authentication centre], using the \"Ki\" and a random value generated\\nby the AUC. The Ki is the secret key that is securely stored on the\\nsmart card [inside the cellphone], and a copy is also stored in the\\nAUC. When the AUC \"tells\" the cellphone the key for that particular\\nconversation, the information passes through the company\\'s MSC [mobile\\nswitching centre].\\n\\n`It is possible to eavesdrop on a certain cellphone if one actively\\nmonitors either the handovers or the connection set-up messages from\\nthe OMC [operations and maintenance centre] or if one knows the Ki in\\nthe smart card.\\n\\n`Both options are entirely possible. The first option, which relies on\\nknowing the A5 encryption key, requires the right equipment. The\\nsecond option, using the Ki, means you have to know the A3/A8\\nalgorithms as well or the Ki is useless. These algorithms can be\\nobtained by hacking the switch manufacturer, i.e. Siemens, Alcatel,\\nMotorola ...\\n\\n`As a call is made from the target cellphone, you need to feed the A5\\nkey into a cellphone which has been modified to let it eavesdrop on\\nthe channel used by the cellphone. Normally, this eavesdropping will\\nonly produce static--since the conversation is encrypted. However,\\nwith the keys and equipment, you can decode the conversation.\\'\\n\\nThis is one of the handover messages, logged with a CCITT7 link\\nmonitor, that he saw:\\n\\n13:54:46\"3 4Rx< SCCP 12-2-09-1 12-2-04-0 13 CR\\n\\nBSSM HOREQ\\n\\nBSSMAP GSM 08.08 Rev 3.9.2 (BSSM) HaNDover REQuest (HOREQ)\\n\\n-------0 Discrimination bit D BSSMAP\\n\\n0000000- Filler\\n\\n00101011 Message Length 43\\n\\n00010000 Message Type 0x10\\n\\nChannel Type\\n\\n00001011 IE Name Channel type\\n\\n00000011 IE Length 3\\n\\n00000001 Speech/Data Indicator Speech\\n\\n00001000 Channel Rate/Type Full rate TCH channel Bm\\n\\n00000001 Speech Encoding Algorithm GSM speech algorithm Ver 1\\n\\nEncryption Information\\n\\n00001010 IE Name Encryption information\\n\\n00001001 IE Length 9\\n\\n00000010 Algorithm ID GSM user data encryption V. 1\\n\\n******** Encryption Key C9 7F 45 7E 29 8E 08 00\\n\\nClassmark Information Type 2\\n\\n00010010 IE Name Classmark information type 2\\n\\n00000010 IE Length 2\\n\\n-----001 RF power capability Class 2, portable\\n\\n---00--- Encryption algorithm Algorithm A5\\n\\n000----- Revision level\\n\\n-----000 Frequency capability Band number 0\\n\\n----1--- SM capability present\\n\\n-000---- Spare\\n\\n0------- Extension\\n\\nCell Identifier\\n\\n00000101 IE Name Cell identifier\\n\\n00000101 IE Length 5\\n\\n00000001 Cell ID discriminator LAC/CI used to ident cell\\n\\n******** LAC 4611\\n\\n******** CI 3000\\n\\nPRIority\\n\\n00000110 IE Name Priority\\n\\n00000001 IE Length 1\\n\\n-------0 Preemption allowed ind not allowed\\n\\n------0- Queueing allowed ind not allowed\\n\\n--0011-- Priority level 3\\n\\n00------ Spare\\n\\nCircuit Identity Code\\n\\n00000001 IE Name Circuit identity code\\n\\n00000000 PCM Multiplex a-h 0\\n\\n---11110 Timeslot in use 30\\n\\n101----- PCM Multiplex i-k 5\\n\\nDownlink DTX flag\\n\\n00011001 IE Name Downlink DTX flag\\n\\n-------1 DTX in downlink direction disabled\\n\\n0000000- Spare\\n\\nCell Identifier\\n\\n00000101 IE Name Cell identifier\\n\\n00000101 IE Length 5\\n\\n00000001 Cell ID discriminator LAC/CI used to ident cell\\n\\n******** LAC 4868\\n\\n******** CI 3200\\n\\nThe beauty of a digital mobile phone, as opposed to the analogue\\nmobile phones still used by some people in Australia, is that a\\nconversation is reasonably secure from eavesdroppers. If I call you on\\nmy digital mobile, our conversation will be encrypted with the A5\\nencryption algorithm between the mobile phone and the exchange. The\\ncarrier has copies of the Kis and, in some countries, the government\\ncan access these copies. They are, however, closely guarded secrets.\\n\\nSKiMo had access to the database of the encrypted Kis and access to\\nsome of the unencrypted Kis themselves. At the time, he never went to\\nthe trouble of gathering enough information about the A3 and A8\\nalgorithms to decrypt the full database, though it would have been\\neasy to do so. However, he has now obtained that information.\\n\\nTo SKiMo, access to the keys generated for each of thousands of German\\nmobile phone conversations was simply a curiosity--and a trophy. He\\ndidn\\'t have the expensive equipment required to eavesdrop. To an\\nintelligence agency, however, access could be very valuable,\\nparticularly if some of those phones belonged to people such as\\npoliticians. Even more valuable would be ongoing access to the OMC, or\\nbetter still, the MSC. SkiMo said he would not provide this to any\\nintelligence agency.\\n\\nWhile inside DeTeMobil, SKiMo also learned how to interpret some of\\nthe mapping and signal-strength data. The result? If one of the\\ncompany\\'s customers has his mobile turned on, SKiMo says he can\\npinpoint the customer\\'s geographic location to within one kilometre.\\nThe customer doesn\\'t even have to be talking on the mobile. All he has\\nto do is have the phone turned on, waiting to receive calls.\\n\\nSKiMo tracked one customer for an afternoon, as the man travelled\\nacross Germany, then called the customer up. It turned out they spoke\\nthe same European language.\\n\\n`Why are you driving from Hamburg to Bremen with your phone on\\nstand-by mode?\\' SKiMo asked.\\n\\nThe customer freaked out. How did this stranger at the end of the\\nphone know where he had been travelling?\\n\\nSKiMo said he was from Greenpeace. `Don\\'t drive around so much. It\\ncreates pollution,\\' he told the bewildered mobile customer. Then he\\ntold the customer about the importance of conserving energy and how\\nprolonged used of mobile phones affected certain parts of one\\'s brain.\\n\\nOriginally, SKiMo broke into the mobile phone carriers\\' network\\nbecause he wanted `to go completely cellular\\'--a transition which he\\nhoped would make him both mobile and much harder to trace. Being able\\nto eavesdrop on other people\\'s calls-- including those of the\\npolice--was going to be a bonus.\\n\\nHowever, as he pursued this project, he discovered that the code from\\na mobile phone manufacturer which he needed to study was `a\\nmulti-lingual project\\'. `I don\\'t know whether you have ever seen a\\nmulti-lingual project,\\' SKiMo says, `where nobody defines a common\\nlanguage that all programmers must use for their comments and function\\nnames? They look horrible. They are no fun to read.\\' Part of this one\\nwas in Finnish.\\n\\nSKiMo says he has hacked a number of major vendors and, in several\\ncases, has had access to their products\\' source codes.\\n\\nHas he had the access to install backdoors in primary source code for\\nmajor vendors? Yes. Has he done it? He says no. On other hand, I asked\\nhim who he would tell if he did do it. `No-one,\\' he said, `because\\nthere is more risk if two people know than if one does.\\'\\n\\nSKiMo is mostly a loner these days. He shares a limited amount of\\ninformation about hacking exploits with two people, but the\\nconversations are usually carefully worded or vague. He substitutes a\\ndifferent vendor\\'s names for the real one, or he discusses technical\\ncomputer security issues in an in-depth but theoretical manner, so he\\ndoesn\\'t have to name any particular system.\\n\\nHe doesn\\'t talk about anything to do with hacking on the telephone.\\nMostly, when he manages to capture a particularly juicy prize, he\\nkeeps news of his latest conquest to himself.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t always that way. `When I started hacking and phreaking, I\\nhad the need to learn very much and to establish contacts which I\\ncould ask for certain things--such as technical advice,\\' SKiMo said.\\n`Now I find it much easier to get that info myself than asking anyone\\nfor it. I look at the source code, then experiment and discover new\\nbugs myself.\\'\\n\\nAsked if the ever-increasing complexity of computer technology hasn\\'t\\nforced hackers to work in groups of specialists instead of going solo,\\nhe said in some cases yes, but in most cases, no. `That is only true\\nfor people who don\\'t want to learn everything.\\'\\n\\nSKiMo can\\'t see himself giving up hacking any time in the near future.\\n\\nWho is on the other side these days?\\n\\nIn Australia, it is still the Australian Federal Police, although the\\nagency has come a long way since the early days of the Computer Crimes\\nUnit. When AFP officers burst in on Phoenix, Nom and Electron, they\\nwere like the Keystone Cops. The police were no match for the\\nAustralian hackers in the subsequent interviews. The hackers were so\\nfar out in front in technical knowledge it was laughable.\\n\\nThe AFP has been closing that gap with considerable alacrity. Under\\nthe guidance of officers like Ken Day, they now run a more technically\\nskilled group of law enforcement officers. In 1995-96, the AFP had\\nabout 2800 employees, although some 800 of these worked in `community\\npolicing\\'--serving as the local police in places like the ACT and\\nNorfolk Island. The AFP\\'s annual expenditure was about $270 million in\\nthat year.\\n\\nAs an institution, the AFP has recently gone through a major\\nreorganisation, designed to make it less of a command-and-control\\nmilitary structure and more of an innovative, service oriented\\norganisation.\\n\\nSome of these changes are cosmetic. AFP officers are now no longer\\ncalled `constable\\' or `detective sergeant\\'--they are all just `federal\\nagents\\'. The AFP now has a `vision\\' which is `to fight crime and\\nwin\\'.3 Its organisational chart had been transformed from a\\ntraditional, hierarchical pyramid of square boxes into a collection of\\nlittle circles linked to bigger circles--all in a circle shape. No\\nphallo-centric structures here. You can tell the politically correct\\nmanagement consultants have been visiting the AFP.\\n\\nThe AFP has, however, also changed in more substantive ways. There are\\nnow `teams\\' with different expertise, and AFP investigators can draw\\non them on an as-needed basis. In terms of increased efficiency, this\\nfluidity is probably a good thing.\\n\\nThere are about five permanent officers in the Melbourne computer\\ncrimes area. Although the AFP doesn\\'t release detailed budget\\nbreakdowns, my back-of-the-envelope analysis suggested that the AFP\\nspends less than $1 million per year on the Melbourne computer crimes\\narea in total. Sydney also has a Computer Crimes Unit.\\n\\nCatching hackers and phreakers is only one part of the unit\\'s job.\\nAnother important task is to provide technical computer expertise for\\nother investigations.\\n\\nDay still runs the show in Melbourne. He doesn\\'t think or act like a\\nstreet cop. He is a psychological player, and therefore well suited to\\nhis opponents. According to a reliable source outside the underground,\\nhe is also a clean cop, a competent officer, and `a nice guy\\'.\\n\\nHowever, being the head of the Computer Crimes Unit for so many years\\nmakes Day an easy target in the underground. In particular, hackers\\noften make fun of how seriously he seems to take both himself and his\\njob. When Day appeared on the former ABC show `Attitude\\', sternly\\nwarning the audience off hacking, he told the viewers, `It\\'s not a\\ngame. It\\'s a criminal act\\'.\\n\\nTo hackers watching the show, this was a matter of opinion. Not long\\nafter the episode went to air, a few members of Neuro-cactus, an\\nAustralian group of hackers and phreakers which had its roots in\\nWestern Australia, decided to take the mickey out of Day. Two members,\\nPick and Minnow, clipped Day\\'s now famous soundbite. Before long, Day\\nappeared to be saying, `It\\'s not a criminal act. It\\'s a game\\'--to the\\nmusical theme of `The Bill\\'. The Neuro-cactus crowd quickly spread\\ntheir lampoon across the underground via an illicit VMB connected to\\nits own toll-free 008 number.\\n\\nAlthough Day does perhaps take himself somewhat seriously, it can\\'t be\\nmuch fun for him to deal with this monkey business week in and week\\nout. More than one hacker has told me with great excitement, `I know\\nsomeone who is working on getting Day\\'s home number\\'. The word is that\\na few members of the underground already have the information and have\\nused it. Some people think it would be hilarious to call up Day at\\nhome and prank him. Frankly, I feel a bit sorry for the guy. You can\\nbet the folks in traffic operations don\\'t have to put up with this\\nstuff.\\n\\nBut that doesn\\'t mean I think these pranksters should be locked up\\neither.\\n\\nIf we, as a society, choose not to lock hackers up, then what should\\nwe do with them?\\n\\nPerhaps a better question is, do we really need to do anything with\\nthem?\\n\\nOne answer is to simply ignore look-see hacking. Society could decide\\nthat it makes more sense to use valuable police resources to catch\\ndangerous criminals--forgers, embezzlers, white-collar swindlers,\\ncorporate spies and malicious hackers--than to chase look-see hackers.\\n\\nThe law must still maintain the capacity to punish hard where someone\\nhas strayed into what society deems serious crime. However, almost any\\nserious crime committed by a hacker could be committed by a non-hacker\\nand prosecuted under other legislation. Fraud, wilful damage and\\ndealing in stolen property are crimes regardless of the medium--and\\nshould be punished appropriately.\\n\\nDoes it make sense to view most look-see hackers--and by that I mean\\nhackers who do not do malicious damage or commit fraud--as criminals?\\nProbably not. They are primarily just a nuisance and should be treated\\nas such. This would not be difficult to do. The law-makers could\\nsimply declare look-see hacking to be a minor legal infringement. In\\nthe worst-case scenario, a repeat offender might have to do a little\\ncommunity service. But such community service needs to be managed\\nproperly. In one Australian case, a corrections officer assigned a\\nhacker to dig ditches with a convicted rapist and murderer.\\n\\nMany hackers have never had a job--in part because of the high youth\\nunemployment in some areas--and so their community service might be\\ntheir first `position\\'. The right community service placement must\\ninvolve hackers using their computer skills to give something back to\\nsociety, preferably in some sort of autonomous, creative project. A\\nhacker\\'s enthusiasm, curiosity and willingness to experiment can be\\ndirected toward a positive outcome if managed properly.\\n\\nIn cases where hacking or phreaking has been an addiction, the problem\\nshould be treated, not criminalised. Most importantly, these hackers\\nshould not have convictions recorded against them, particularly if\\nthey\\'re young. As Paul Galbally said to the court at Mendax\\'s\\nsentencing, `All the accused are intelligent--but their intelligence\\noutstretched their maturity\\'.  Chances are, most will be able to\\novercome or outgrow their addiction.\\n\\nIn practice, most Australia\\'s judges have been reasonably fair in\\ntheir sentencing, certainly compared to judges overseas. None of the\\nAustralian hackers detailed in this work received a prison sentence.\\nPart of this is due to happenstance, but part is also due to the sound\\njudgments of people like Judge Lewis and Judge Kimm. It must be very\\ntempting, sitting on the bench every day, to shoot from the hip\\ninterpreting new laws.\\n\\nAs I sat in court listening to each judge, it quickly became clear\\nthat these judges had done their homework. With psychologist Tim\\nWatson-Munro on the stand, Judge Lewis rapidly zeroed in on the\\nsubject of `free will\\'--as applied to addiction--regarding Prime\\nSuspect. In Trax\\'s case, Judge Kimm asked pointed questions which he\\ncould only have formulated after serious study of the extensive legal\\nbrief. Their well-informed judgments suggested a deeper understanding\\nboth of hacking as a crime, and of the intent of the largely untested\\ncomputer crime legislation.\\n\\nHowever, a great deal of time and money has been wasted in the pursuit\\nof look-see hackers, largely because this sort of hacking is treated\\nas a major crime. Consider the following absurd situation created by\\nAustralia\\'s federal computer criminal legislation.\\n\\nA spy breaks into a computer at the Liberal Party\\'s headquarters and\\nreads the party\\'s top-secret election strategy, which he may want to\\npass on to the Labor Party. He doesn\\'t insert or delete any data in\\nthe process, or view any commercial information. The penalty under\\nthis legislation? A maximum of six months in prison.\\n\\nThat same spy decides he wants to get rich quick. Using the local\\ntelephone system, he hacks into a bank\\'s computer with the intention\\nof defrauding the financial institution. He doesn\\'t view any\\ncommercial or personal information, or delete or insert any files. Yet\\nthe information he reviews--about the layout of a bank building, or\\nhow to set off its fire alarm or sprinkler system--proves vital in his\\nplan to defraud the bank. His penalty: a maximum of two years prison.\\n\\nOur spy now moves onto bigger and better things. He penetrates a\\nDepartment of Defence computer with the intention of obtaining\\ninformation about Australia\\'s military strategies and passing it on to\\nthe Malaysians. Again, he doesn\\'t delete or insert any data--he just\\nreads every sensitive planning document he can find. Under the federal\\nanti-hacking laws, the maximum penalty he would receive would also be\\ntwo years prison.\\n\\nMeanwhile, a look-see hacker breaks into a university computer without\\ndoing any damage. He doesn\\'t delete any files. He FTPs a public-domain\\nfile from another system and quietly tucks it away in a hidden, unused\\ncorner of the university machine. Maybe he writes a message to someone\\nelse on-line. If caught, the law, as interpreted by the AFP and the\\nDPP, says he faces up to ten years in prison. The reason? He has\\ninserted or deleted data.\\n\\nAlthough the spy hacker might also face other charges--such as\\ntreason--this exercise illustrates some of the problems with the\\ncurrent computer crime legislation.\\n\\nThe letter of the law says that our look-see hacker might face a\\nprison term five times greater than the bank fraud criminal or the\\nmilitary spy, and twenty times greater than the anti-Liberal Party\\nsubversive, if he inserts or deletes any data. The law, as interpreted\\nby the AFP, says that the look-see hacking described above should have\\nthe same maximum ten-year prison penalty as judicial corruption. It\\'s\\na weird mental image--the corrupt judge and the look-see hacker\\nsharing a prison cell.\\n\\nAlthough the law-makers may not have fully understood the\\ntechnological aspects of hacking when they introduced the computer\\ncrimes legislation, their intent seems clear. They were trying to\\ndifferentiate between a malicious hacker and a look-see hacker, but\\nthey could have worded it better.\\n\\nAs it\\'s worded, the legislation puts malicious, destructive hacking on\\na par with look-see hacking by saying that anyone who destroys,\\nerases, alters or inserts data via a carrier faces a prison term,\\nregardless of the person\\'s intent. There is no gradation in the law\\nbetween mere deletion of data and `aggravated deletion\\'--the maximum\\npenalty is ten years for both. The AFP has taken advantage of this\\nlack of distinction, and the result has been a steady stream of\\nlook-see hackers being charged with the most serious computer crime\\noffences.\\n\\nParliament makes the laws. Government institutions such as the AFP,\\nthe DPP and the courts interpret and apply those laws. The AFP and to\\nsome extent the DPP have applied the strict letter of the law\\ncorrectly in most of the hacking cases described in this book. They\\nhave, however, missed the intention of the law. Change the law and\\nthey may behave differently. Make look-see hacking a minor offence and\\nthe institutions will stop going after the soft targets and hopefully\\nspend more time on the real criminals.\\n\\nI have seen some of these hackers up close, studied them for two years\\nand learned a bit about what makes them tick. In many ways, they are\\nquintessentially Australian, always questioning authority and\\nrebelling against `the establishment\\'. They\\'re smart--in some cases\\nvery smart. A few might even be classified as technical geniuses.\\nThey\\'re mischievous, but also very enterprising. They\\'re rebels,\\npublic nuisances and dreamers.\\n\\nMost of all, they know how to think outside the box.\\n\\nThis is not a flaw. Often, it is a very valuable trait--and one which\\npushes society forward into new frontiers. The question shouldn\\'t be\\nwhether we want to crush it but how we should steer it in a different\\ndirection.\\n\\nEND\\n\\nIf you would like to comment on this book, please write to\\nfeedback@underground-book.net.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses.
