    "### Evaluating Models \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training Set Accuracy\n",
    "Training set accuracy is when we take all the data we trained the model on and use it to determine the accuracy of that same trained model. It's important to remember that the goal of most traditional machine learning tasks is to take existing examples and produce something which generalises to new examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "In an issue known as overfitting, a model may have high training set accuracy, but when given new examples will perform poorly. In our text blog example, this means the model has learnt to identify the exact blog posts it has seen before, rather than learning something intrinsic about all space or hockey emails that would allow it to correctly label novel ones under different circumstances in the wild. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Validation Set Accuracy\n",
    "To get a more accurate measure of accuracy (meta, right?), you can hold back some of your data from training and use this to evaluate your model during development. This way your model is being tested on unseen data and you can have more confidence it will work when you put it into production. Proportions for this split vary, but 10% is often used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with test set accuracy is that you lose some of your precious data for training. Also, if you have small datasets, a 10% split of an already small number of examples may not actually give you much of an idea about how well your model is performing. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that no one method is right for all situations and compromises often have to be made. It's also important to note that these methods will only work as well as your data is good. They wonât, for example, spot bias in your model if your test set also lacks the necessary diversity. \n",
